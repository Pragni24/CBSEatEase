        <h2>Tips and tricks to help you preapre!!</h2>
        <h3>A Positive Mindset to Achieve Your Goals</h3>
        <p>It takes time to develop important traits like motivation and a desire to succeed. You can accomplish your goals when you think positively. It requires more than merely working harder and trying harder. It's a mindset that you have to practise from the moment you begin studying for your tests until the day you take them.</p>
        <h3>Create a Study Plan According to Your Interest and Schedule</h3>
        <p>It is the most effective approach to guarantee that you are studying every subject in time for the test. Divide your studies into digestible portions, and utilise the plan to help you stay on course. Making a study plan and following it is essential, regardless of whether you are a returning candidate or taking the exam for the first time. You can maximise your energy and reduce your stress levels with the right preparation, which will enable you to perform at your highest level and increase your chances of receiving a good score on the test.<br>
        <b>You can also use the 45 days plan provided by us and modify it according to your schedule.</b></p>
        <h3>Take Regular Breaks and Stay Hydrated</h3>
        <p>To make sure you are in the right frame of mind to remember what you have just learned, take breaks during your study sessions and drink plenty of water. When studying, take regular breaks, eat healthily, and stay hydrated. To ensure that your mind is rested and prepared for the exam, try to arrive at least 30 minutes before the start time, even if you don't feel like studying.
</p>
        <h3>Take Mock Tests to Assess Your Level of Preparedness</h3>
        <p>Taking a practice exam will help you gauge how much time and effort you will need to put in, which is the best way to make sure you are ready for the real thing. Take practice exams in addition to or as a component of your board exam preparation. This can only be accomplished efficiently by working with a mentor who has previously completed the same topics and taking multiple practice exams. </p>
        <h3>Use Mnemonics and Memory Aids </h3>
        <p>Acquiring all the knowledge required for a board exam can be challenging, particularly if you are a last-minute learner. Make your own mnemonics and memory aids before you begin studying to help you understand challenging material. The best method to retain information for a board exam is to come up with mnemonics, or learning aids, which are words, word groups, or learning images. The acronym BITE, which stands for "big idea, tiny example," is a common mnemonic that aids in remembering the most crucial subjects and allows us to practise learning information in manageable chunks.</p>
        <h3>Use Pomodoro Timer</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro technique is a smarter way of effectively using time management to complete your tasks. Developed by Francesco Cirillo, the owner of Cirillo Consulting, the Pomodoro technique is an effective time management method.

The Pomodoro technique helps a user to effectively deal with time while performing a task and also helps in higher productivity as an outcome.<br>
        <b>You can use the Pomodoro Timer provided on our website</b></p>
