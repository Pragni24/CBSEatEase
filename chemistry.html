		<h3>Topic 1: Types of Solutions</h3>
		<h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Write one difference in each of the following : <br>
			(i) Lyophobic sol and Lyophilic sol <br>
			(ii) Solution and Colloid <br>
			(iii) Homogeneous catalysis and Heterogeneous catalysis                                        (Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- (i) Lyophobic sols are solvent-repelling and are not easily dispersed in solvents, requiring special methods for stabilization. Lyophilic sols are solvent-loving and readily disperse in solvents without requiring special methods for stabilization.<br><br>
			(ii) Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where the solute is uniformly distributed in the solvent at the molecular level. Colloids, on the other hand, are heterogeneous mixtures where the dispersed phase (colloidal particles) is dispersed throughout the dispersion medium but not at the molecular level, resulting in larger particles that scatter light.<br><br>
			(iii) Homogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants. Heterogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in a different phase (usually solid) from the reactants.<br><br>

		         <h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Define the following terms:<br>
			(i) Molarity<br>
			(ii) Molal elevation constant (K<sub>b</sub>) (Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- <br>
			(i) Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in one liter (1 L) of solution. It is expressed as:<br>
			Molarity (M) = Number of moles of solute/Volume of solution in liters<br>
			<br>
			(ii) Molal elevation constant (Kb) is a constant specific to a solvent that relates the elevation in boiling point of the solvent to the molality of the solution. It is used in the equation:<br>
			ΔT<sub>b</sub> = K<sub>b</sub> x molality<br>
			where ΔT<sub>b</sub> is the elevation in boiling point of the solvent.<br><br>

		<p>
			Q1- A solution of glucose (molar mass = 180 g mol<sub>-1</sub>) in water is labelled as 10% (by mass). What would be the molality and molarity of the solution ?(Density of solution = 1.2 g mL<sub>-1</sub>) (Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Given that,<br>
			Mass % of the solution = 10%<br>
			-> 10g of solute dissolve in 100g solution<br>
			Density of the solution, ρ = 1.2g/ml<br>
			Molar mass of solute, M<sub>B</sub> = 180g/mol<br>
			Mass of solute, W<sub>B</sub> = 10g<br>
			Mass of the solvent, W<sub>A</sub> = (100-10)g = 90g<br>
			<br>
			Molality(m) = (n<sub>B</sub>/W<sub>A</sub>(g)) x 1000 = ((W<sub>B</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)/W<sub>A</sub>) x 1000<br>
			=((10/180)/90) x 1000 m<br>
			= 50/81 m <br>
			= 0.617m<br><br>
			Volume of 100g solution, V = W/ρ = 100g/1.2g/ml<br>
			=250/3 ml<br>
			Therefore,<br>
			Molarity(M) = (n<sub>B</sub>/V(ml)) x 1000<br>
			((W<sub>B</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)/V(ml)) x 1000<br>
			=((10/180)/(250/3)) x 1000 M<br>
			=2/3 M<br>
			=0.667 M<br><br>

		<h3>Topic 3: Solubility</h3>
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Write the main reason for the stability of colloidal sols. (Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- The main reason for the stability of colloidal sols is the presence of charge on the colloidal particles, which leads to electrostatic repulsion between them. This repulsion prevents the particles from aggregating and keeps the colloid stable.<br><br>
			
		
		</p>
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Out of BaCl<sub>2</sub> and KCl, which one is more effective in causing coagulation of a negatively charged colloidal Sol ? Give reason. (Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) is more effective in causing coagulation of a negatively charged colloidal sol compared to potassium chloride (KCl). This is because Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions have a higher charge density than K<sup>+</sup> ions. The higher charge density of Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions results in stronger electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged colloidal particles, leading to greater coagulation or precipitation of the colloidal particles.<br><br>

		<h3>Topic 4: Vapour Pressure of Liquid Solutions</h3>
		<h3>Topic 5: Ideal and Non-Ideal Solutions</h3>
		         <h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- What type of deviation is shown by a mixture of ethanol and acetone ? Give reason.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- A mixture of ethanol and acetone shows positive deviation from Raoult's law.
			<br>
			In positive deviation, the vapor pressure of the solution is higher than predicted by Raoult's law. This occurs because the intermolecular forces between the unlike molecules (ethanol and acetone) are weaker than the forces between like molecules (ethanol-ethanol and acetone-acetone). As a result, more molecules escape from the solution surface, increasing the vapor pressure compared to the ideal behavior predicted by Raoult's law.<br><br>

			Q2- State Raoult’s law for a solution containing volatile components. Write two characteristics of the solution which obeys Raoult’s law at all concentrations. (55/6/1 - 2019)(55/6/2 - 2019)(55/6/3 - 2019)<br>
			Solution- According to Raoult's law, the vapour pressure of a solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly proportional to the solvent's mole fraction.<br>
			ρ<sub>solution</sub> = K<sub>H</sub><sup>x</sup><sub>solution</sub><br>
			<br>
			Examine a binary solution consisting of two liquid components, A and B. Let pA and pB represent the partial pressures of component A and component B, respectively, and let p total represent the total vapour pressure of the solution caused by both components.<br><br>
			ρ<sub>A</sub> = x<sub>A</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>A</sub><br>
			ρ<sub>B</sub> = x<sub>B</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>B</sub><br><br>
			The total vapor pressure of the solution of liquids A and B is then, by Dalton's law of partial pressures, the sum of ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>B</sub>.<br>
			ρ<sub>Total</sub>=ρ<sub>A</sub>+ρ<sub>B</sub><br>
			Substituting for ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>B</sub>, we get<br>
			ρ<sub>Total</sub> = X<sub>A</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>A</sub>+ X<sub>B</sub> + ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>B</sub><br><br>
			The following attributes of the solution that, at all concentrations, complies with Raoult's law are present: <br>
			(i) The enthalpy of mixing (ΔH<sub>mix</sub>) in a binary solution of components A and B is zero, meaning that no thermal change is seen during the preparation of an ideal solution. <br>
			(ii) The volume of mixing (ΔV<sub>mix</sub>) in an ideal solution is likewise zero, meaning that the total volume of the solution equals the sum of the volumes of the components that are being mixed.<br><br>

		<h3>Topic 6: Colligative Properties and Determination of Molar Mass </h3>
		<h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Define the following terms : <br>
			(i) Colligative properties <br>
			(ii) Molality (m)                                   (Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-3)<br><br>
			Solution- (i) Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend only on the number of solute particles present in the solution, not on the identity of the solute particles. Examples include lowering of vapor pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point, and osmotic pressure.<br><br>
			(ii) Molality (m) is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, expressed as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.<br><br>

			Q1- A solution containing 15 g urea (molar mass = 60 g mol<sup>-1</sup>) per litre of solution in water has the same osmotic pressure (isotonic) as a solution of glucose (molar mass = 180 g mol<sup>-1</sup>) in water. Calculate the mass of glucose present in one litre of its solution. (Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>

			Solution- According to the Nernst equation<br>
			E<sub>cell</sub>=E<sup>0</sup><sup>cell</sup> - (2.303RT/nF) log(C<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>1</sub>)<br>

			Q1- (a) Following reactions occur at cathode during the electrolysis of aqueous silver chloride solution : <br>
			Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + e<sup>-</sup> → Ag(s)          E° = +0.80 V <br>

			On the basis of their standard reduction electrode potential (E°) values, which reaction is feasible at the cathode and why ? <br>
			(b) Define limiting molar conductivity. Why conductivity of an electrolyte solution decreases with the decrease in concentration ? (Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-3)<br>
			Solution-<br>
			(a) On the basis of their standard reduction potential (E°) values, cathode reaction is given by the one with higher E° values. <br>
			Thus Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + e<sup>-</sup> →  Ag(s) reaction will be more feasible at cathode.<br>
			(b) Limiting molar conductivity is the molar conductivity of an electrolyte solution at infinite dilution. It is the molar conductivity value when the electrolyte is completely dissociated into ions and there is no further increase in conductivity with increasing dilution.<br>
			The conductivity of an electrolyte solution decreases with the decrease in concentration because as the concentration decreases, the number of ions available to carry the current decreases. This results in a decrease in the overall conductivity of the solution.<br><br>

			Q1-	(i) Write the IUPAC name of the complex [Cr(NH3)4 Cl2]Cl. <br>
				(iii) Why is [NiCl4]2– paramagnetic but [Ni(CO)4] is diamagnetic ?	(56/1, 2014)(56/2, 2014)(56/3, 2014)<br>
					(At. nos. : Cr = 24,  Co = 27,  Ni = 28)	<br>
			Solution-<br>
				(i) The IUPAC name of the complex[Cr(NH3)4Cl2]Cl is Tetraamminedichlorochromium(III) chloride.<br>
			
				(iii) In [NiCl4]2−, the oxidation state of Ni is +2. Chloride is a weak field ligand and does not cause pairing up of electrons 
				against the Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. As a result, two unpaired electrons are present in the valence 
				d-orbitals of Ni which impart paramagnetic character to the complex. On the other hand, carbonyl is a strong field ligand 
				and causes pairing up of electrons against the Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. As a result, no unpaired electrons 
				are present and hence, the complex is diamagnetic.<br>
