		<h3>Topic 1: Types of Solutions</h3>
		<h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Write one difference in each of the following : <br>
			(i) Lyophobic sol and Lyophilic sol <br>
			(ii) Solution and Colloid <br>
			(iii) Homogeneous catalysis and Heterogeneous catalysis                                        (Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- (i) Lyophobic sols are solvent-repelling and are not easily dispersed in solvents, requiring special methods for stabilization. Lyophilic sols are solvent-loving and readily disperse in solvents without requiring special methods for stabilization.<br><br>
			(ii) Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where the solute is uniformly distributed in the solvent at the molecular level. Colloids, on the other hand, are heterogeneous mixtures where the dispersed phase (colloidal particles) is dispersed throughout the dispersion medium but not at the molecular level, resulting in larger particles that scatter light.<br><br>
			(iii) Homogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants. Heterogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in a different phase (usually solid) from the reactants.<br><br>

			Q1- A solution of glucose (molar mass = 180 g mol<sub>-1</sub>) in water is labelled as 10% (by mass). What would be the molality and molarity of the solution ?(Density of solution = 1.2 g mL<sub>-1</sub>) (Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Given that,<br>
			Mass % of the solution = 10%<br>
			-> 10g of solute dissolve in 100g solution<br>
			Density of the solution, ρ = 1.2g/ml<br>
			Molar mass of solute, M<sub>B</sub> = 180g/mol<br>
			Mass of solute, W<sub>B</sub> = 10g<br>
			Mass of the solvent, W<sub>A</sub> = (100-10)g = 90g<br>
			<br>
			Molality(m) = (n<sub>B</sub>/W<sub>A</sub>(g)) x 1000 = ((W<sub>B</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)/W<sub>A</sub>) x 1000<br>
			=((10/180)/90) x 1000 m<br>
			= 50/81 m <br>
			= 0.617m<br><br>
			Volume of 100g solution, V = W/ρ = 100g/1.2g/ml<br>
			=250/3 ml<br>
			Therefore,<br>
			Molarity(M) = (n<sub>B</sub>/V(ml)) x 1000<br>
			((W<sub>B</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)/V(ml)) x 1000<br>
			=((10/180)/(250/3)) x 1000 M<br>
			=2/3 M<br>
			=0.667 M<br><br>

		<h3>Topic 3: Solubility</h3>
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Write the main reason for the stability of colloidal sols. (Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- The main reason for the stability of colloidal sols is the presence of charge on the colloidal particles, which leads to electrostatic repulsion between them. This repulsion prevents the particles from aggregating and keeps the colloid stable.<br><br>
			
		
		</p>
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Out of BaCl<sub>2</sub> and KCl, which one is more effective in causing coagulation of a negatively charged colloidal Sol ? Give reason. (Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) is more effective in causing coagulation of a negatively charged colloidal sol compared to potassium chloride (KCl). This is because Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions have a higher charge density than K<sup>+</sup> ions. The higher charge density of Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions results in stronger electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged colloidal particles, leading to greater coagulation or precipitation of the colloidal particles.<br><br>

		<h3>Topic 4: Vapour Pressure of Liquid Solutions</h3>
		<h3>Topic 5: Ideal and Non-Ideal Solutions</h3>
		         <h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- What type of deviation is shown by a mixture of ethanol and acetone ? Give reason.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- A mixture of ethanol and acetone shows positive deviation from Raoult's law.
			<br>
			In positive deviation, the vapor pressure of the solution is higher than predicted by Raoult's law. This occurs because the intermolecular forces between the unlike molecules (ethanol and acetone) are weaker than the forces between like molecules (ethanol-ethanol and acetone-acetone). As a result, more molecules escape from the solution surface, increasing the vapor pressure compared to the ideal behavior predicted by Raoult's law.<br><br>

			Q2- State Raoult’s law for a solution containing volatile components. Write two characteristics of the solution which obeys Raoult’s law at all concentrations. (55/6/1 - 2019)(55/6/2 - 2019)(55/6/3 - 2019)<br>
			Solution- According to Raoult's law, the vapour pressure of a solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly proportional to the solvent's mole fraction.<br>
			ρ<sub>solution</sub> = K<sub>H</sub><sup>x</sup><sub>solution</sub><br>
			<br>
			Examine a binary solution consisting of two liquid components, A and B. Let pA and pB represent the partial pressures of component A and component B, respectively, and let p total represent the total vapour pressure of the solution caused by both components.<br><br>
			ρ<sub>A</sub> = x<sub>A</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>A</sub><br>
			ρ<sub>B</sub> = x<sub>B</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>B</sub><br><br>
			The total vapor pressure of the solution of liquids A and B is then, by Dalton's law of partial pressures, the sum of ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>B</sub>.<br>
			ρ<sub>Total</sub>=ρ<sub>A</sub>+ρ<sub>B</sub><br>
			Substituting for ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>B</sub>, we get<br>
			ρ<sub>Total</sub> = X<sub>A</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>A</sub>+ X<sub>B</sub> + ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>B</sub><br><br>
			The following attributes of the solution that, at all concentrations, complies with Raoult's law are present: <br>
			(i) The enthalpy of mixing (ΔH<sub>mix</sub>) in a binary solution of components A and B is zero, meaning that no thermal change is seen during the preparation of an ideal solution. <br>
			(ii) The volume of mixing (ΔV<sub>mix</sub>) in an ideal solution is likewise zero, meaning that the total volume of the solution equals the sum of the volumes of the components that are being mixed.<br><br>

			(i) Colligative properties <br>
			(ii) Molality (m)                                   (Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-3)<br><br>
			Solution- (i) Colligative properties are properties of solutions that depend only on the number of solute particles present in the solution, not on the identity of the solute particles. Examples include lowering of vapor pressure, elevation of boiling point, depression of freezing point, and osmotic pressure.<br><br>
			(ii) Molality (m) is a measure of the concentration of a solute in a solution, expressed as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.<br><br>

			(b) Define limiting molar conductivity. Why conductivity of an electrolyte solution decreases with the decrease in concentration ? (Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-3)<br>
			Solution-<br>
			(a) On the basis of their standard reduction potential (E°) values, cathode reaction is given by the one with higher E° values. <br>
			Thus Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + e<sup>-</sup> →  Ag(s) reaction will be more feasible at cathode.<br>
			(b) Limiting molar conductivity is the molar conductivity of an electrolyte solution at infinite dilution. It is the molar conductivity value when the electrolyte is completely dissociated into ions and there is no further increase in conductivity with increasing dilution.<br>
			The conductivity of an electrolyte solution decreases with the decrease in concentration because as the concentration decreases, the number of ions available to carry the current decreases. This results in a decrease in the overall conductivity of the solution.<br><br>

			Q1- Lanthanoid contraction is due to increase in : (55/1/1 2022 Term 1) (55/1/3 2022 Term 1)<br>
			(a) atomic number<br> (b) shielding by 4f electrons<br> (c) effective nuclear charge<br> (d) atomic radius<br>
			Solution- (C)<br>
			The lanthanoid contraction refers to the fact that the 5s and 5p orbitals penetrate the 4f sub-shell so the 4f orbital is not shielded from the increasing nuclear change, which causes the atomic radius of the atom to decrease.<br>

		<h3>Topic 3: The Actinoids </h3>
		<h4>1 Mark Questions</h4>
			<p>
			Q1- The chemistry of actinoids elements is not so smooth as that of the lanthanoids. Why? (56/3 2017) (56/2 2017)<br>
			Solution- Lanthanoids display a limited number of oxidation states because the energy difference between 4f, 5d, and 6s orbitals is quite large. On the other hand, the energy difference between 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals is very less. Hence, actinoids display a larger number of oxidation states.<br>

		<h3>Topic 1: Werner’s Theory of Coordination Compounds </h3>
		<h4>4 Marks</h4>
		<p>
				Q1- Coordination compounds are widely present in the minerals, plant and animal worlds and are known to play many important functions in the area of analytical chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems and medicine.Alfred Werner's postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary), by a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. He predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities using the property of isomerism. The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to describe the optical properties of these compounds. The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) explains the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges) on the degeneracy of d-orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. <br>
				Answer the following questions :  (56/3/1, 2023)<br>
 				(i) When a coordination compound NiCl2 . 6H2O is mixed with AgNO3 solution, 2 moles of AgCl are precipitated per mole of the compound. Write the structural formula of the complex and secondary valency for Nickel ion.  <br>
			 	(ii) Write the IUPAC name of the ionisation isomer of [Co(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)]Cl.  <br>
 				(iii) Using Valence Bond Theory, predict the geometry and magnetic nature of :  <br>
  					(1) [Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>]  <br>
 					(2) [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3-</sup> <br>

		<p>
			Q1-	(i) Write the IUPAC name of the complex [Cr(NH3)4 Cl2]Cl. <br>
				(iii) Why is [NiCl4]2– paramagnetic but [Ni(CO)4] is diamagnetic ?	(56/1, 2014)(56/2, 2014)(56/3, 2014)<br>
					(At. nos. : Cr = 24,  Co = 27,  Ni = 28)	<br>
			Solution-<br>
				(i) The IUPAC name of the complex[Cr(NH3)4Cl2]Cl is Tetraamminedichlorochromium(III) chloride.<br>
			
				(iii) In [NiCl4]2−, the oxidation state of Ni is +2. Chloride is a weak field ligand and does not cause pairing up of electrons 
				against the Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. As a result, two unpaired electrons are present in the valence 
				d-orbitals of Ni which impart paramagnetic character to the complex. On the other hand, carbonyl is a strong field ligand 
				and causes pairing up of electrons against the Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. As a result, no unpaired electrons 
				are present and hence, the complex is diamagnetic.<br>

			<img src = "chemCh5top5Q1.png" alt = ""><br>
			(b) Which halogen compound in each of the following pairs will react faster in SN2 reaction : <br>
			(i) CH<sub>3</sub>Br  or  CH<sub>3</sub>I <br>
			(ii) (CH3)<sub>3</sub>C – Cl  or  CH<sub>3</sub> – Cl		(56/1, 2014))(56/2, 2014)(56/3, 2014)<br>
			
			Solution- <br>
			(a) <img src="chemCh6Q1Top5.png" alt="Reaction"><br>
			
			(b)<br>
			(i)	CH<sub>3</sub>I will react faster in SN2 reaction than CH<sub>3</sub>Br. This is because I− is a better leaving group, owing to its greater size than Br−. 
				As a result, it will leave at a faster rate in the presence of an incoming nucleophile.<br>

			(ii)    CH<sub>3</sub>Cl will react faster in SN2 reaction than (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>−Cl, as CH<sub>3</sub>−Cl is a primary halide whereas (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C−Cl is a tertiary halide. 
				Primary halides undergo SN2 reactions faster.<br>
