		<h3>Topic 1: Types of Solutions</h3>
		<h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Write one difference in each of the following : <br>
			(i) Lyophobic sol and Lyophilic sol <br>
			(ii) Solution and Colloid <br>
			(iii) Homogeneous catalysis and Heterogeneous catalysis                                        (Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- (i) Lyophobic sols are solvent-repelling and are not easily dispersed in solvents, requiring special methods for stabilization. Lyophilic sols are solvent-loving and readily disperse in solvents without requiring special methods for stabilization.<br><br>
			(ii) Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where the solute is uniformly distributed in the solvent at the molecular level. Colloids, on the other hand, are heterogeneous mixtures where the dispersed phase (colloidal particles) is dispersed throughout the dispersion medium but not at the molecular level, resulting in larger particles that scatter light.<br><br>
			(iii) Homogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in the same phase as the reactants. Heterogeneous catalysis occurs when the catalyst is in a different phase (usually solid) from the reactants.<br><br>

			(ii) Molal elevation constant (K<sub>b</sub>) (Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- <br>
			(i) Molarity (M) is defined as the number of moles of solute dissolved in one liter (1 L) of solution. It is expressed as:<br>
			Molarity (M) = Number of moles of solute/Volume of solution in liters<br>
			<br>
			(ii) Molal elevation constant (Kb) is a constant specific to a solvent that relates the elevation in boiling point of the solvent to the molality of the solution. It is used in the equation:<br>
			ΔT<sub>b</sub> = K<sub>b</sub> x molality<br>
			where ΔT<sub>b</sub> is the elevation in boiling point of the solvent.<br><br>

		<p>
			Q1- A solution of glucose (molar mass = 180 g mol<sub>-1</sub>) in water is labelled as 10% (by mass). What would be the molality and molarity of the solution ?(Density of solution = 1.2 g mL<sub>-1</sub>) (Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Given that,<br>
			Mass % of the solution = 10%<br>
			-> 10g of solute dissolve in 100g solution<br>
			Density of the solution, ρ = 1.2g/ml<br>
			Molar mass of solute, M<sub>B</sub> = 180g/mol<br>
			Mass of solute, W<sub>B</sub> = 10g<br>
			Mass of the solvent, W<sub>A</sub> = (100-10)g = 90g<br>
			<br>
			Molality(m) = (n<sub>B</sub>/W<sub>A</sub>(g)) x 1000 = ((W<sub>B</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)/W<sub>A</sub>) x 1000<br>
			=((10/180)/90) x 1000 m<br>
			= 50/81 m <br>
			= 0.617m<br><br>
			Volume of 100g solution, V = W/ρ = 100g/1.2g/ml<br>
			=250/3 ml<br>
			Therefore,<br>
			Molarity(M) = (n<sub>B</sub>/V(ml)) x 1000<br>
			((W<sub>B</sub>/M<sub>B</sub>)/V(ml)) x 1000<br>
			=((10/180)/(250/3)) x 1000 M<br>
			=2/3 M<br>
			=0.667 M<br><br>

		<h3>Topic 3: Solubility</h3>
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Write the main reason for the stability of colloidal sols. (Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- The main reason for the stability of colloidal sols is the presence of charge on the colloidal particles, which leads to electrostatic repulsion between them. This repulsion prevents the particles from aggregating and keeps the colloid stable.<br><br>
			
		
		</p>
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Out of BaCl<sub>2</sub> and KCl, which one is more effective in causing coagulation of a negatively charged colloidal Sol ? Give reason. (Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) is more effective in causing coagulation of a negatively charged colloidal sol compared to potassium chloride (KCl). This is because Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions have a higher charge density than K<sup>+</sup> ions. The higher charge density of Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions results in stronger electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged colloidal particles, leading to greater coagulation or precipitation of the colloidal particles.<br><br>

			Solution- (D) shows negative deviation from Raoult's law   <br><br>
		</p>
		         <h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- What type of deviation is shown by a mixture of ethanol and acetone ? Give reason.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- A mixture of ethanol and acetone shows positive deviation from Raoult's law.
			<br>
			In positive deviation, the vapor pressure of the solution is higher than predicted by Raoult's law. This occurs because the intermolecular forces between the unlike molecules (ethanol and acetone) are weaker than the forces between like molecules (ethanol-ethanol and acetone-acetone). As a result, more molecules escape from the solution surface, increasing the vapor pressure compared to the ideal behavior predicted by Raoult's law.<br><br>

			Q2- State Raoult’s law for a solution containing volatile components. Write two characteristics of the solution which obeys Raoult’s law at all concentrations. (55/6/1 - 2019)(55/6/2 - 2019)(55/6/3 - 2019)<br>
			Solution- According to Raoult's law, the vapour pressure of a solution containing a non-volatile solute is directly proportional to the solvent's mole fraction.<br>
			ρ<sub>solution</sub> = K<sub>H</sub><sup>x</sup><sub>solution</sub><br>
			<br>
			Examine a binary solution consisting of two liquid components, A and B. Let pA and pB represent the partial pressures of component A and component B, respectively, and let p total represent the total vapour pressure of the solution caused by both components.<br><br>
			ρ<sub>A</sub> = x<sub>A</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>A</sub><br>
			ρ<sub>B</sub> = x<sub>B</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>B</sub><br><br>
			The total vapor pressure of the solution of liquids A and B is then, by Dalton's law of partial pressures, the sum of ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>B</sub>.<br>
			ρ<sub>Total</sub>=ρ<sub>A</sub>+ρ<sub>B</sub><br>
			Substituting for ρ<sub>A</sub> and ρ<sub>B</sub>, we get<br>
			ρ<sub>Total</sub> = X<sub>A</sub>ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>A</sub>+ X<sub>B</sub> + ρ<sup>0</sup><sub>B</sub><br><br>
			The following attributes of the solution that, at all concentrations, complies with Raoult's law are present: <br>
			(i) The enthalpy of mixing (ΔH<sub>mix</sub>) in a binary solution of components A and B is zero, meaning that no thermal change is seen during the preparation of an ideal solution. <br>
			(ii) The volume of mixing (ΔV<sub>mix</sub>) in an ideal solution is likewise zero, meaning that the total volume of the solution equals the sum of the volumes of the components that are being mixed.<br><br>

			Q3- Differentiate between Ideal solution and Non-ideal solution.  (55/6/1- 2023)(55/6/2- 2023)(55/6/3- 2023)<br>
			Solution- <b></b>Ideal Solution:</b><br><br>
		- Follows Raoult's law at all concentrations and temperatures.<br>
		- Shows ideal behavior, meaning there are no interactions between the solute-solute, solvent-solvent, or solute-solvent particles.<br>
		- The vapor pressure of each component is directly proportional to its mole fraction in the solution.<br>
		- The enthalpy of mixing is zero.<br>
		- The heat of vaporization of the components remains constant.<br><br>
		<b>Non-ideal Solution:</b><br><br>
		- Does not follow Raoult's law at all concentrations and temperatures.<br>
		- Shows non-ideal behavior, indicating interactions between the solute-solute, solvent-solvent, or solute-solvent particles.<br>
		- The vapor pressure of each component is not directly proportional to its mole fraction in the solution.<br>
		- The enthalpy of mixing is not zero.<br>
		- The heat of vaporization of the components may change with composition.<br><br>

			(b) Define limiting molar conductivity. Why conductivity of an electrolyte solution decreases with the decrease in concentration ? (Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-3)<br>
			Solution-<br>
			(a) On the basis of their standard reduction potential (E°) values, cathode reaction is given by the one with higher E° values. <br>
			Thus Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + e<sup>-</sup> →  Ag(s) reaction will be more feasible at cathode.<br>
			(b) Limiting molar conductivity is the molar conductivity of an electrolyte solution at infinite dilution. It is the molar conductivity value when the electrolyte is completely dissociated into ions and there is no further increase in conductivity with increasing dilution.<br>
			The conductivity of an electrolyte solution decreases with the decrease in concentration because as the concentration decreases, the number of ions available to carry the current decreases. This results in a decrease in the overall conductivity of the solution.<br><br>

			Q1- The rate of reaction is concerned with decrease in concentration of reactants or increase in the concentration of products per unit time. It can be expressed as instantaneous rate at a particular instant of time and average rate over a large interval of time. Mathematical representation of rate of reaction is given by rate law.

			(a) atomic number<br> (b) shielding by 4f electrons<br> (c) effective nuclear charge<br> (d) atomic radius<br>
			Solution- (C)<br>
			The lanthanoid contraction refers to the fact that the 5s and 5p orbitals penetrate the 4f sub-shell so the 4f orbital is not shielded from the increasing nuclear change, which causes the atomic radius of the atom to decrease.<br>

			Q1- The chemistry of actinoids elements is not so smooth as that of the lanthanoids. Why? (56/3 2017) (56/2 2017)<br>
			Solution- Lanthanoids display a limited number of oxidation states because the energy difference between 4f, 5d, and 6s orbitals is quite large. On the other hand, the energy difference between 5f, 6d, and 7s orbitals is very less. Hence, actinoids display a larger number of oxidation states.<br>

		<h3>Topic 1: Werner’s Theory of Coordination Compounds </h3>
		<h4>4 Marks</h4>
		<p>
				Q1- Coordination compounds are widely present in the minerals, plant and animal worlds and are known to play many important functions in the area of analytical chemistry, metallurgy, biological systems and medicine.Alfred Werner's postulated the use of two types of linkages (primary and secondary), by a metal atom/ion in a coordination compound. He predicted the geometrical shapes of a large number of coordination entities using the property of isomerism. The Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains the formation, magnetic behaviour and geometrical shapes of coordination compounds. It, however, fails to describe the optical properties of these compounds. The Crystal Field Theory (CFT) explains the effect of different crystal fields (provided by the ligands taken as point charges) on the degeneracy of d-orbital energies of the central metal atom/ion. <br>
				Answer the following questions :  (56/3/1, 2023)(56/3/3, 2023)<br>

				(i) The IUPAC name of the complex[Cr(NH3)4Cl2]Cl is Tetraamminedichlorochromium(III) chloride.<br>
			
				(iii) In [NiCl4]2−, the oxidation state of Ni is +2. Chloride is a weak field ligand and does not cause pairing up of electrons 
				against the Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. As a result, two unpaired electrons are present in the valence 
				d-orbitals of Ni which impart paramagnetic character to the complex. On the other hand, carbonyl is a strong field ligand 
				and causes pairing up of electrons against the Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. As a result, no unpaired electrons 
				are present and hence, the complex is diamagnetic.<br>

					  <h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
					  <p>
						  Q1-Explain the classification of alcohols, phenols, and ethers based on their functional groups and provide examples for each class.<br>
						  Solution- Alcohols:<br>
Alcohols are organic compounds that contain a hydroxyl (-OH) functional group attached to a carbon atom. They can be classified based on the type of carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is attached:<br>

Primary Alcohols: Primary alcohols have the hydroxyl group attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to only one other carbon atom.<br>
Example: Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH)<br>
Secondary Alcohols: Secondary alcohols have the hydroxyl group attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to two other carbon atoms.<br>
Example: Isopropanol (CH₃CHOHCH₃)<br>
Tertiary Alcohols: Tertiary alcohols have the hydroxyl group attached to a carbon atom that is bonded to three other carbon atoms.<br>
Example: Tert-butanol (CH₃)₃COH<br>
Phenols:<br>
Phenols are aromatic compounds that contain a hydroxyl (-OH) group directly attached to a benzene ring. They can be classified based on the substitution pattern on the benzene ring:<br>

Mono-substituted Phenols: Mono-substituted phenols have only one substituent (other than the hydroxyl group) attached to the benzene ring.<br>
Example: Phenol (C₆H₅OH)<br>
Di-substituted Phenols: Di-substituted phenols have two substituents attached to the benzene ring.<br>
Example: 2,4-Dimethylphenol (CH₃)₂C₆H₃OH<br>
Ethers:<br>
Ethers are organic compounds that contain an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. They can be classified based on the nature of the groups attached to the oxygen atom:<br>

Symmetrical Ethers: Symmetrical ethers have identical alkyl or aryl groups attached to the oxygen atom.<br>
Example: Dimethyl ether (CH₃OCH₃)<br>
Unsymmetrical Ethers: Unsymmetrical ethers have different alkyl or aryl groups attached to the oxygen atom.<br>
Example: Methyl ethyl ether (CH₃OCH₂CH₃)<br>

						  Q1-Explain the classification of alcohols, phenols, and ethers. Discuss the structural features, functional groups, and properties of each class of compounds. Provide examples to illustrate the differences between them and their importance in various industrial and biological processes.(2018)<br>
						  Solution-Classification of Alcohols, Phenols, and Ethers:<br>

Alcohols: Alcohols are organic compounds containing a hydroxyl (-OH) functional group attached to a carbon atom. They are classified based on the number of carbon atoms bonded directly to the carbon atom bearing the hydroxyl group.<br>

Primary alcohols: Have one carbon atom directly bonded to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (R-CH2OH).<br>
Secondary alcohols: Have two carbon atoms directly bonded to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (R2-CHOH).<br>
Tertiary alcohols: Have three carbon atoms directly bonded to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group (R3-COH).<br>
Phenols: Phenols are aromatic compounds containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) directly attached to a benzene ring. They are characterized by their acidic properties due to the resonance stabilization of the phenoxide ion formed upon deprotonation of the hydroxyl group.<br>

Ethers: Ethers are organic compounds containing an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. They are classified based on the nature of the groups attached to the oxygen atom.<br>

Symmetrical ethers: Have identical alkyl or aryl groups on both sides of the oxygen atom (R-O-R).<br>
Unsymmetrical ethers: Have different alkyl or aryl groups on either side of the oxygen atom (R1-O-R2)<br>.
Structural Features and Properties:<br>

Alcohols: Alcohols exhibit polar characteristics due to the presence of the hydroxyl group. They can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, making them soluble in water. Alcohols undergo various chemical reactions, including oxidation, dehydration, and substitution reactions.<br>

Example: Methanol (CH3OH), ethanol (C2H5OH), propanol (C3H7OH).<br>
Phenols: Phenols are acidic due to the ability of the hydroxyl group to donate a proton. They are less soluble in water compared to alcohols but are soluble in organic solvents. Phenols undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions and can act as antioxidants and disinfectants.<br>

Example: Phenol (C6H5OH), cresol.<br>
Ethers: Ethers are relatively inert and do not undergo many chemical reactions under normal conditions. They are often used as solvents for organic reactions and as anesthetics due to their low reactivity and ability to induce unconsciousness.<br>

Example: Diethyl ether (C2H5OC2H5), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).<br>
Importance in Industrial and Biological Processes:<br>

Alcohols are widely used as solvents, disinfectants, fuels, and in the synthesis of various organic compounds.<br>
Phenols are utilized in the production of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and antiseptic agents.<br>
Ethers find applications as solvents, anesthetics, and fuel additives in gasoline.<br>
In conclusion, alcohols, phenols, and ethers are important classes of organic compounds with distinct structural features, properties, and applications in various industrial and biological processes. Understanding their classification and characteristics is essential for their synthesis, manipulation, and utilization in diverse fields.<br><br>

					  <h3>Topic 2:Nomenclature</h3>
					  <h4>1 Mark Questions</h4>
					  <p>
						  Q1-Define nomenclature in the context of organic chemistry.(2015)<br>
						  Solution-Nomenclature in organic chemistry refers to the systematic method of naming organic compounds based on their structure and functional groups according to specific rules and conventions.<br><br>

						  <h4>3 Mark Question</h4>
						  <p>
							  Q1-Explain the principles of nomenclature in organic chemistry. Discuss the importance of systematic naming conventions and provide examples illustrating the application of IUPAC rules for naming organic compounds.(2014)<br>
							  Solution-Principles of Nomenclature in Organic Chemistry:<br>

Nomenclature in organic chemistry involves the systematic naming of organic compounds according to standardized rules established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The key principles of nomenclature include:<br>

Priority of Functional Groups: Functional groups present in organic compounds are given priority in naming. The highest priority functional group determines the base name of the compound.<br>

Parent Chain: The longest continuous chain of carbon atoms, also known as the parent chain, serves as the backbone of the compound's name. The parent chain should include the functional group and provide the basis for numbering the carbon atoms.<br>

Substituent Groups: Any alkyl or other substituent groups attached to the parent chain are named as prefixes and located using numerical prefixes to indicate their position on the parent chain.<br>

Multiple Substituents: In case of multiple substituents, they are listed alphabetically in the compound name. Numerical prefixes are used to indicate the number of each type of substituent.<br>

Importance of Systematic Naming Conventions:<br>

Systematic naming conventions are essential in organic chemistry for the following reasons:<br>

Clarity and Precision: Systematic names provide a clear and unambiguous way to identify and communicate the structure of organic compounds. This ensures accuracy and precision in scientific literature and communication.<br>

Consistency: Standardized naming conventions promote consistency and uniformity in the naming of organic compounds across different regions and languages, facilitating global communication and collaboration in chemistry.<br>

Chemical Understanding: Systematic names convey information about the structure, functional groups, and substituents present in organic compounds, enhancing understanding of their chemical properties and reactivity.<br>

Examples of Application of IUPAC Rules:<br>

Ethanol (C2H5OH): The parent chain is a two-carbon chain, and the hydroxyl group (-OH) takes precedence as the functional group. Therefore, the compound is named as ethanol.<br>

3-Methylpentane (C6H14): The longest continuous chain contains five carbon atoms (pentane). The methyl group (CH3) is attached to the third carbon atom, so the compound is named as 3-methylpentane.<br>

2-Bromo-4-chlorohexane (C6H13BrCl): The parent chain is a six-carbon chain (hexane). Bromine and chlorine substituents are attached to the second and fourth carbon atoms, respectively, so the compound is named as 2-bromo-4-chlorohexane.<br>

In conclusion, systematic naming conventions based on IUPAC rules play a crucial role in accurately and precisely identifying organic compounds. They ensure clarity, consistency, and chemical understanding, making them indispensable tools in organic chemistry.<br><br>

			<p> 
				Q1:Describe the process of transcription.(2019)<br>
			 Solution:Transcription is the process by which a strand of RNA is synthesized from a DNA template. It occurs in the nucleus. The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of DNA called the promoter. The RNA polymerase then unwinds the DNA double helix and synthesizes a complementary RNA strand using one of the DNA strands as a template. The RNA strand is elongated until a termination signal is reached, at which point RNA polymerase releases the RNA strand, and the DNA helix reforms.
			 <br><br>

				Q2:Explain the process of translation.(2014)<br>
			 Solution:Translation is the process by which the genetic information encoded in mRNA is used to synthesize a specific protein. It occurs in the cytoplasm at the ribosomes. During translation, tRNA molecules carry specific amino acids to the ribosome, where they are added to the growing polypeptide chain according to the mRNA codons. This process continues until a stop codon is reached, at which point the ribosome releases the completed protein.

				Q3:Differentiate between the functions of DNA and RNA.(2021)<br>
			 Solution:DNA primarily serves as the genetic material that stores and transmits genetic information, while RNA plays various roles in protein synthesis, including carrying the genetic information from DNA to the ribosomes (mRNA), bringing amino acids to the ribosomes during protein synthesis (tRNA), and forming a part of the ribosomes (rRNA).

Memory updated
Here are some 5-mark questions along with their answers on nucleic acids for CBSE Class 12 board exams:

Question 1: Describe the structure of a nucleotide. Explain how nucleotides are linked together to form a polynucleotide chain.

Answer:

Structure of a Nucleotide: A nucleotide consists of three components: a pentose sugar (either ribose or deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine).
Linkage of Nucleotides: Nucleotides are linked together through a phosphodiester bond between the 3' carbon of one nucleotide's sugar and the 5' carbon of the next nucleotide's sugar. This forms a sugar-phosphate backbone with nitrogenous bases extending from the backbone.
Q2: Explain the process of DNA replication. Include the role of enzymes and the significance of semi-conservative replication.

Solution:

Process of DNA Replication: DNA replication is the process by which DNA makes an identical copy of itself. It involves several steps:
Initiation: DNA unwinds at the origin of replication, forming a replication bubble.
Elongation: DNA polymerase synthesizes a new DNA strand by adding nucleotides complementary to the template strand.
Termination: Replication is completed when two daughter DNA molecules are formed.
Role of Enzymes: Enzymes such as helicase unwind the DNA double helix, DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the growing DNA strand, and DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.
Significance of Semi-Conservative Replication: Semi-conservative replication ensures that each daughter DNA molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand, preserving the genetic information.

			 <h3>Topic 6:Hormones</h3>
		      <h4>3 Mark Questions</h4>
			<p> 		  
				Q1:Describe the role of hormones in the human body.(2020)<br>
			 Solution:Hormones are chemical messengers produced by endocrine glands that regulate various physiological processes in the human body. They play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and coordinating growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. Hormones act on target cells or organs, where they bind to specific receptors and trigger specific cellular responses. Examples of hormones include insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels, and adrenaline, which is involved in the body's response to stress.

			 <h4>5 Mark Questions</h4>
			<p> 	
				Q1: Explain the classification and functions of hormones in the human body.(2017)<br>
			 Solution:Hormones are classified based on their chemical structure and function into three main types: steroids, peptides/proteins, and amines.
<br>
Steroid Hormones: Steroid hormones are derived from cholesterol and are lipid-soluble. Examples include cortisol, aldosterone, and sex hormones (such as estrogen and testosterone). These hormones regulate various physiological processes, including metabolism, immune response, and sexual development.
<br>
Peptide/Protein Hormones: Peptide and protein hormones are made up of amino acids and are water-soluble. Examples include insulin, glucagon, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). These hormones regulate growth, metabolism, and energy balance.
<br>
Amine Hormones: Amine hormones are derived from amino acids and can be either water-soluble or lipid-soluble. Examples include adrenaline, noradrenaline, and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). These hormones regulate the body's response to stress, metabolism, and heart rate.
<br>
Hormones function by binding to specific receptors on target cells or organs, initiating a signaling cascade that leads to a specific cellular response. This response can include changes in gene expression, enzyme activation, or ion channel opening. Hormones play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and coordinating various physiological processes in the body.
