    <h3>Topic 1: Organism and their Population</h3>
		<h4>1 Mark Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Why are mango trees unable to grow in temperate climate? (65/1 2013) (65/3 2013)<br>
			Solution- Mango trees are unable to grow in temperate climate because low temperature affects the kinetics of enzyme’s functioning and through this basal metabolism, activity and other physiological functions of the organism get affected.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q2- Give an example of an organism that enters ‘diapause’ and why?  (65/2 2015) (65/3 2015)<br>
			Solution- Many zooplanktons in lakes and ponds enter diapause so, as to escape unfavourable environmental conditions and to delay their overall development.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q3- Mention how do bears escape from stressful time in winter? (65/1 2016) (65/2 2016)<br>
			Solution- Bears escape from stressful time in winter by going into hibernation.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q4- Write the basis on which an organism occupies a space in its community/natural surroundings. (65/2 2018) (65/3 2018)<br>
			Solution- An organism occupies individual or species level in its community. This level is occupied on the basis of ecological level of organisation or ecological hierarchy.<br>
      Individual → Population → Biotic community → Biome<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q5- How do animals like fishes and snails avoid summer related unfavourable conditions? (65/1 2020) (65/3 2020)<br>
			Solution- Fishes migrate and snails undergo into aestivation or summer sleep to avoid summer related problems.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q6- How do seed bearing plants tide over dry and hot weather conditions?  (65/1 2023) (65/2 2023)<br>
			Solution- During unfavourable conditions, seed-bearing plants reduce their metabolic activities and undergo a state of dormancy. The seeds germinate under favourable moisture and temperate conditions.<br>
		</p>

    <h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Why the plants that inhabit a desert are not found in a mangrove? Give reasons. (65/2 2013) (65/3 2013)<br>
			Solution- Desert plants are not found in a mangrove because in xerophytic (desert) condition, plant roots grow deeply to explore any possibility of underground water, lehves are highly reduced (spines) to minimise transpiration. While mangroves grow in marshy areas. Their roots grow vertically upwards from the soil for the absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere as the soil is poorly aerated. These roots are called pneumatophores.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q2- Shark is eurythermal, while polar bear is stenothermal. What is the advantage the former has and what is the constraint the later has? (65/1 2016) (65/3 2016)<br>
			Solution- The organisms that can tolerate and thrive in wide range of temperature are called eurythermal and those restricted to narrow range of temperatures are called stenothermal.
      The levels of thermal tolerance of different species determine to a large extent their geographical distribution. Hence, eurythermal organisms (e.g. sharks) have vast geographical distribution as compared to stenothermal organisms (e.g. polar bears) that are limited to certain areas only.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q3- How does our body adapt to low oxygen availability at high altitudes?  (65/1 2019) (65/2 2019)<br>
			Solution- When we go for a trip to any high altitude places, we are advised to take it easy and rest for first two days because we may suffer from high altitude sickness. At low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, body does not get enough oxygen, hence symptoms like nausea, fatigue start appearing. So, the body requires time to acclimatise to these conditions.
      Some body adaptations at high altitudes are increase in the production of red blood cells to compensate low oxygen and faster breathing rate.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q4- Hummingbirds live among the bushes in tropics, while penguins live on icebergs. They cannot survive if their habitats are reversed. Justify. (65/3 2021) (65/2 2021)<br>
			Solution- When we go for a trip to any high altitude places, we are advised to take it easy and rest for first two days because we may suffer from high altitude sickness. At low atmospheric pressure of high altitudes, body does not get enough oxygen, hence symptoms like nausea, fatigue start appearing. So, the body requires time to acclimatise to these conditions.
      Some body adaptations at high altitudes are increase in the production of red blood cells to compensate low oxygen and faster breathing rate.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q5- State Gause’s ‘competitive exclusion’ principle. How have the recent studies modified this principle? (65/1 2022) (65/2 2022)<br>
			Solution- Gause’s competitive exclusion principle states that two closely related species competing for the same resources cannot coexist indefinitely and the competitively inferior one will be eliminated eventually (true if resources are limiting). This principle 
      has been modified to ‘complete competitors cannot coexist’ one of the primary ways niche-sharing species can coexist is the competition-colonisation trade-off. In simple terms, species that are better competitors will be specialists, whereas species that are better 
      colonisers are more likely to be generalists.<br>
		</p>

    <h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- During a school trip to ‘Rohtang Pass’, one of your classmate suddenly developed ‘altitude sickness’. But, he/she recovered after some time.<br>
      (i) Mention one symptom to diagnose the sickness.<br>
      (ii) What caused the sickness?<br>
      (iii) How could she/he recover by her/himself after some time? (65/1 2014) (65/3 2014)<br>
			Solution- (i) The primary symptoms of ‘altitude sickness’ are headache, nausea, fatigue, etc.<br>
      (ii) Sickness was caused due to the low atmospheric pressure prevailing at high altitude. Due to this, the body gets deprived of sufficient oxygen.<br>
      (iii) Ascending slowly is the best way to avoid altitude sickness. This way the body compensates low oxygen availability by increasing red blood cells production, decreasing the binding capacity of haemoglobin and by increasing breathing rate. Thus, she/he recovers by herself after some time.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q2- In certain seasons we sweat profusely, while in some other season we shiver. Explain. (65/3 2015) (65/2 2015)<br>
			Solution- In certain seasons, we sweat profusely while in some other season we shiver to maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis ensures constant body temperature and constant osmotic concentration of the body. It is maintained by following means. Human body maintains constant body temperature (37°C) by following way.<br>
      In summers, the outside temperature is very high than our body temperature. Due to this, profuse sweating occurs. This causes evaporation and cooling effect on the body.<br>
      In winters, the outside temperature is much lower than our body temperature. This causes shivering, a kind of exercise that produces heat and raises the body temperature.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q3- Explain with the help of suitable examples the three different ways by which organisms overcome their stressful conditions lasting for short duration. (65/1 2017) (65/2 2017)<br>
			Solution- Organisms either migrate or suspend their metabolic activities, when conditions are stressful for short duration. However, in the absence of migration, following mechanisms help an organism to overcome adverse conditions:-<br>
      (i) Metabolic activities are reduced to undergo a state of dormancy, e.g. higher plants.<br>
      (ii) Hibernates (frogs) or aestivates (snails) or undergo diapause (zooplanktons).<br>
      (iii) Thick-walled spores are formed in stressful conditions and germinate under suitable conditions, e.g. bacteria, fungi and lower groups of plants.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q4- In certain seasons we sweat profusely, while in some other season we shiver. Explain. (65/3 2020) (65/2 2022)<br>
			Solution- Ways to adapt to unfavourable conditions are:-<br>
      (i) Snails undergo aestivation (summer sleep) to avoid summer related problems.<br>
      (ii) Bears undergo hibernation during winter.<br>
      (iii) Zooplanktons enter a stage of suspended development called diapause.<br>
      (iv) Bacteria and fungi slow down their metabolic rate and form a thick-walled spores to overcome stressful conditions. These spores germinate after the onset of suitable environment.<br>
      (v) Seeds undergo a state of dormancy during unfavourable conditions and germinate under favourable conditions.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q5- Water is very essential for life. Write any three features both for plants and animals, which enable them to survive in water scarce environment. (65/1 2023) (65/2 2023)<br>
			Solution- Three features in plants and animals that enable them to survive in water scarce environment are as follows:-<br>
      # Adaptations in Plants:<br>
      (i) Thick cuticle on their leaf surface.<br>
      (ii) Stomata are arranged in deep pits (sunken) to minimise water loss through transpiration.<br>
      (iii) Leaves are reduced to spines. The photosynthetic function is carry out by thick, fleshy, flattened stems.<br>
      # Adaptations in Animals:<br>
      (i) Kangaroo rat meets the water requirement through internal oxidation of fats.<br> 
      (ii) They concentrate their urine, so that minimum volume of water is excreted.<br>
      (iii) Snails undergo aestivation during summers.<br>

    <h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12: Ecosystem</h2>
    <h3>Topic 1: Ecosystem and its Types</h3>
		<h4>1 Mark Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- What does ‘R’ represent in the given equation for productivity in an ecosystem => GPP – R = NPP (65/1 2013) (65/3 2013)<br>
			Solution- In the given equation for productivity in an ecosystem, GPP – R = NPP, ‘R’ represents the energy utilised by plants or producers in respiration. It is also referred to as respiratory losses.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q2- How is the net primary productivity of an ecosystem derived ?  (65/2 2015) (65/3 2015)<br>
			Solution- Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is the weight of the organic matter stored by the producers which is available to heterotrophs for consumption. It is equal to the rate of organic matter produced during photosynthesis. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) minus respiratory losses (R) yields NPP, i.e. NPP = GPP – R.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q3- Why are green algae not likely to be found in the deepest strata of the ocean? (65/1 2016) (65/2 2016)<br>
			Solution- Green algae survive by utilisation of food synthesised by themselves through photosynthesis. At deepest layer in ocean, light is absent. 
      So, photosynthesis does not take place and hence, green algae are not likely to be found in deep strata of ocean.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q4- State what does standing crop of a trophic level represent. (65/2 2018) (65/3 2018)<br>
			Solution- Standing crop of a trophic level represents the total mass of living material or energy content of all the organisms of a trophic level at a particular time and location.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q5- Mention the role of pioneer species in primary succession on rocks. (65/1 2020) (65/3 2020)<br>
			Solution- Lichens are the pioneer species in the primary succession on rocks. They secrete acids to dissolve the rock and help in weathering and soil formation and pave way for small plants like bryophytes.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q6- The pyramid of energy is always upright. Explain. (65/1 2023) (65/2 2023)<br>
			Solution- Pyramid of energy is always upright, i.e., it can never be inverted because when enegy is transferred from a particular trophic level to the next trophic level, some energy is always lost as heat at each step.<br>
		</p>
    
    <h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Mention any two reasons, why the primary productivity varies in different types of ecosystems. (65/2 2013) (65/3 2013)<br>
			Solution- The primary productivity varies in different types of ecosystems because-<br>
      (i) It depends upon plant species (producers) of a given ecosystem and their photosynthetic capacity.<br>
      (ii)It is dependent on various environmental factors, availability of nutrients.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q2- How does the dead organic matter get decomposed in nature? Explain. (65/1 2016) (65/3 2016)<br>
			Solution- In nature, the decomposer organisms like bacteria and fungi act on the dead organic matter and decompose it by relearing various digestive enzymes.<br>
      The process of breaking down of complex organic matter into inorganic substances like CO2, water and nutrients by bacteria and fungi is called decomposition.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q3- Describe how do oxygen and chemical composition of detritus control decomposition. (65/1 2019) (65/2 2019)<br>
			Solution- (1) Effect of oxygen The decomposition of detritus is largely an oxygen requiring process. Most of the decomposers (bacteria and fungi) are aerobic organisms. They require oxygen for their cellular activities while acting on dead organic matter.<br>
      (2) Effect of chemical composition Decomposition rate is slower, if detritus is rich in lignin and chitin. It is quicker if detritus is rich in nitrogen and water soluble substances like sugars.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q4- Justify the importance of decomposer in an ecosystem. (65/3 2021) (65/2 2021)<br>
			Solution- When a plant or animal dies, it leaves behind nutrients and energy in the organic material present in it’s body.Decomposers complete the decomposition process by breaking down this organic matter into NH4, CO2 and nutrients.<br> This releases raw nutrients in a form, which is usable to plants again. This process resupplies nutrients to the ecosystem. When the decomposers feed on dead organisms, they leave behind nutrients. These nutrients become part of the soil.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q5- Discuss the relationship between detritus food chain and grazing food chain in a terrestrial ecosystem. (65/1 2022) (65/2 2022)<br>
			Solution- (i) The producers occupy the first trophic level in terrestrial ecosystem and thus, make base of food chain. These producers (plants) are grazed upon by the grazers (herbivores). Primary carnivores prey upon herbivores and are eaten up by secondary carnivores.<br>
      (ii) The decomposers act on all dead animals/plants and return nutrients stored in them to the soil. These nutrients are again used up by the plants and cycle goes on.
      This way the grazing food chain and detritus food chain are linked up.<br>
		</p>

    <h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- How does a detritivore differ from a decomposer? Explain with an example. (65/1 2014) (65/3 2014)<br>
			Solution- <br><img src = "bioch12.png" alt = "bioc12"><br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q2- (i) What is a trophic level in an ecosystem ? What is ‘standing crop’ with reference to it?<br>
      (ii) Explain the role of the ‘first trophic level’ in an ecosystem.<br>
      (iii) How is the detritus food chain connected with the grazing food chain in a natural ecosystem? (65/3 2015) (65/2 2015)<br>
			Solution- (i) Trophic level Organisms occupy a place in the natural surroundings or in a community according to their feeding relationship with the other organisms. Organisms also occupy a specific place in the food chain on the basis of their nutrition or food. It is known as trophic level.
      Standing crop refers to the mass of a living material at a particular time in a trophic level.<br>
      (ii) First trophic level consists of producers. These are autotrophs. They trap the light energy and convert it into chemical energy.
      The organisms of other trophic levels, i.e. consumers, depend on them for their energy and food requirement. Thus, first trophic level plays a very important role in the ecosystem.<br>
      (iii) Connection between grazing food chain and detritus food chain. Grazing food chain and detritus food chain are connected to each other.
      Nutrients released by decomposers of detritus food chain are utilised by plants or autotrophs of grazing food chain. These plants in turn transfer these nutrients to other organisms. The dead remains of these organisms are source of food for the decomposers.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q3- (i) Taking example of a small pond, explain how the four components of an ecosystem function as a unit.<br>
      (ii) Name the type of food chain that exists in a pond. (65/1 2017) (65/2 2017)<br>
			Solution- (i) Following are the four components of pond ecosystem which function as unit:-<br>
      (1) Abiotic (light, temperature, water)<br>
      (2) Autotrophs (producers mainly phytoplanktons)<br>
      (3) Heterotrophs (zooplankton, small fishes, big fishes)<br>
      (4) Decomposers (bacteria, fungi)<br>
      Pond ecosystem is self-sustainable unit.<br>
      Abiotic components are water, inorganic nutrients dissolved in water, light, temperature. Biotic components are producers like algae and aquatic plants. Consumers are zooplanktons, larvae, tadpole and some fishes. Primary carnivores are water beetles, scorpions, dragonfly larvae, Hydra and some fishes. Decomposers include fungi, bacteria and some flagellates.<br>
      This pond system performs all the functions of an ecosystem, which are given below:-<br>
      (1) Autotrophs They convert inorganic materials with the help of solar energy.<br>
      (2) Heterotrophs They consume autotrophs.<br>
      (3) Decomposers They decompose and mineralise dead organic materials to release them back for reuse by the autotrophs. The above events are repeated again and again.<br>
      (ii) Grazing food chain exists in a pond.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q4- Mention four significant services that a healthy forest ecosystem provide. (65/3 2020) (65/2 2022)<br>
			Solution- Four significant services that a healthy forest ecosystem provide are as follows:-<br>
      (i) Provisioning services Fruits, vegetables, trees, fishes and livestock are directly available to us by ecosystem. The other benefits in this category are timber, oils, medicines, etc.<br>
      (ii) Regulating services These are benefits that moderate natural phenomenon. These include pollination, decomposition, flood control, etc.<br>
      (iii)Cultural services It contributes towards the development and advancement of people, e.g. recreation facilities, spiritual healing, etc.
      (iv) Supporting services Allow the earth to sustain basic life forms, e.g. photosynthesis, water cycle, etc.<br>

		</p>
    		<p>
			Q3- Why is tropical environment able to support greater species diversity? (65/1 2016) (65/2 2016)<br>
			Solution- Tropical latitudes have less seasonal variations and constant environment which promote niche and greater species diversity.<br>
		</p>
    		<p>
			Q4- Eichhornia crassipes is an alien hydrophyte introduced in India. Mention the problem posed by this plant. (65/2 2018) (65/3 2018)<br>
			Solution- Water hyacinth (Eichhomia) introduced in India is threatening the existing aquatic life in ponds and lakes, etc., as it clogs the stagnant waterbodies very fast, thus, the native species are threatened.<br>
		</p>
    		<p>
			Q5- The Amazon rainforest is referred to as the lungs of planet. Mention any one human activity which causes loss of biodiversity in this region. (65/1 2020) (65/3 2020)<br>
			Solution- Many plants are cut in Amazon rainforest for cultivation of soybeans.<br>
		</p>
    		<p>

			Solution- India has more than 50000 strains of rice which shows the genetic level of biodivesity of rice.<br>
		</p>

    <h4>2 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Sometimes alien species affect the indigenous organisms leading to their extinction. Substantiate this statement with the help of any two examples. (65/2 2013) (65/3 2013)<br>
			Solution- Alien species become invasive, compete with the native species and cause extinction of indigenous species. Some alien species are:-<br>
			(i) Introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria leads to extinction of more than 200 species of cichlid fish in that lake.
			(ii) Carrot grass (Parthenium) and Lantana introduced in our country have become invasive and cause environmental damage. They pose a threat to the native species of plants in our forests.<br>
		</p>
    		<p>
			Q2- Substantiate with the help of one example that in an ecosystem mutualists.<br>
			(i) tend to coevolve<br>
			(ii) are also one of the major causes of biodiversity loss. (65/1 2016) (65/3 2016)<br>
			Solution- (i) In nature mutualists often co-evolve such as mediterranean orchid Ophrys. Ophrys employs sexual deceit to get pollinated by a species of bee. One petal of flower resembles to female bee. If female bee changes its colour pattern even slightly the success of pollination will be reduced unless orchid flower coevolves to maintain resemblance with female bee.<br>
			(ii) Coextinction is the one of the Evil Quartet in which organism with obligatory relationship like plant pollinator mutualism will result in extinction of one partner, if other is eliminated in nature.<br>
		</p>
    		<p>
			Q3- List four causes of biodiversity loss. (65/1 2019) (65/2 2019)<br>
			Solution- The four causes of biodiversity loss are as follows:-<br>
			(i) Habitat loss and fragmentation<br>
			(ii) Overexploitation<br>
			(iii) Alien species invasions<br>
			(1v) Coextinctions.<br>
		</p>
    		<p>
			Q4- In the biosphere, immense biological diversity exists at all levels of biological organisation. Explain any two levels of biodiversity. (65/3 2021) (65/2 2021)<br>
			Solution- Levels of Biodiversity in Biosphere:-<br>
			(i) Genetic diversity: It refers to the diversity of genes within a species. For example, there are more than 50000 genetically different strains of rice in India.<br>
			(ii) Species diversity: It refers to the number of different species within a given region. For example. Western Ghats have a greater amphibian species diversity than Eastern Ghats.<br>
		</p>
    <p>
			Q5- Name and explain any two ways that are responsible for the loss of biodiversity. (65/1 2022) (65/2 2022)<br>
			Solution- Causes of biodiversity losses are as follows:-<br>
			Habitat Loss and Fragmentation : The main cause of extinction of species is the destruction of their habitat. For example, tropical rainforests once covering more than 14% of the land surface, now cover only 6% of land area.<br>
			Overexploitation of natural resources byhumans results in degradation and extinction of the resources. For example, Steller’s sea cow, passenger pigeon and many marine fishes have become extinct in last 500 years.<br>
		</p>

    <h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Where would you expect more species biodiversity in tropics or in polar regions? Give reasons in support of your answer. (65/1 2014) (65/3 2014)<br>
			Solution- Biodiversity is more in tropical latitudes than in temperate or in polar regions. The reasons are:-<br>
			(i) Speciation is a function of time. The temperate regions were subjected to frequent glaciation in the past, while the tropics have remained undisturbed and so had longer time to evolve more species diversity.
			(ii) More solar radiation is available in tropical region. This leads directly to more productivity and indirectly to greater species diversity.
			(iii) The environment of tropics is less seasonal and relatively more constant and predictable, which encourages niche specialisation and species diversity.
		</p>
    <p>
			Q2- Write the difference between genetic biodiversity and species biodiversity that exists at all the levels of biological organisation. (65/3 2015) (65/2 2015)<br>
			Solution- <br><img src = "bioch13diff.png" alt = "bioc13"><br>
    <p>
			Q3- Since the origin of life on earth, there were five episodes of mass extinction of species.<br>
			(i) How is the ‘Sixth extinction’, presently in progress, different from the previous episodes?<br>
			(ii) Who is mainly responsible for ‘Sixth Extinction’?<br>
			(iii) List any four points that can help to overcome this disaster, outside (65/1 2017) (65/2 2017)<br>
			Solution- (i) The current species extinction rate is estimated to be 100-1000 time faster than in the pre-human era.<br>
			(ii) All activities performed by human beings for survival and maintenance of their lifestyle.<br>
			(iii) Point that can help to overcome this disaster are as follows:-<br>
			-> Preventing habitat loss and fragmentation.<br>
			-> Checking overexploiting.<br>
			-> Preventing alien species invasion.<br>
			-> Preventing coextinction.<br>
			-> Conservation/protection of species.<br>
		</p>
    		<p>
			Q4- Explain by giving example, how coextinction is one of the causes of loss of biodiversity. List the other three causes also (without description). (65/3 2020) (65/2 2022)<br>
			Solution- Coextinction is one of the causes of loss of biodiversity as when a species becomes extinct, the plant and animal species associated with it in an obligatory manner also become extinct.<br>
			For example, in plant pollinator mutualism, extinction of one results in the extinction of other. Also, if a host fish becomes extinct, the unique parasites depending on it would also become extinct.<br>
			The other causes of loss of biodiversity are:-<br>
			(1) Habitat loss fragmentation<br>
			(2) Overexploitation<br>
			(3) Invasion of alien species.<br>

	Q5- Explain rivet popper hypothesis. Name the ecologist who proposed it. (65/1 2023) (65/2 2023)<br>
	Solution- Rivet Popper Hypothesis is:-<br>
	-> The hypothesis was proposed by Paul Ehrlich.<br>
	-> In an airplane (ecosystem), all parts are joined together using thousands of rivets (species).<br>
	-> If every passenger travelling in it, starts popping a rivet to take home (causing a species to become extinct), it may not affect the flight safety (proper functioning of ecosystem) initially, but as more and more rivets are removed, the plane becomes dangerously weak after some time.<br>
	-> Further, loss of rivets on the wings. (Key species that drive major ecosystem function) is obviously a more serious threat to flight safety than loss of a few rivets on the seats or windows inside the plane.<br>
