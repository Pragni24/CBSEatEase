			Q1- Does the charge given to a metallic sphere depend on whether it is hollow or solid? Give reason for your answer. (Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- The charge given to a metallic sphere does not depend on whether it is hollow or solid. This is because the charge resides on the surface of the conductor due to electrostatic repulsion, and it distributes itself uniformly over the surface regardless of the internal structure of the sphere.<br><br>

            <h3>Topic 8: Electric Field Lines</h3>
		<h4>1Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Why do the electrostatic field lines not form closed loops?(Outside Delhi Scheme Set-2, 2014)<br>
		        Solution- The positive charge is where the electrostatic field lines begin, and they terminate at the negative charge. The electrostatic field lines do not form closed loops because there is an isolated positive and negative charge present. They can never start and finish at the same location.<br><br>
			
			Q2- Why do the electric field lines never cross each other ?(Outside Delhi Scheme 2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Electric lines of force never intersect each other because at the point of intersection, two tangents can be drawn to the two lines of force. This means two direction of electric field at the point of intersection, which is not possible.<br><br>

			Solution- (a)<br>
			<img src="ch1top9_5mq1.jpg"><br>
			(i) When an electric field is present, the conductor's free charge carriers shift the charge distribution and cause it to self-adjust, resulting in a zero net electric field inside the conductor.  <br>
			(ii) By stretching or reorienting the molecules in a dielectric, the external electric field creates a net dipole moment. The induced dipole moment causes the electric field to oppose the external electric field, albeit not completely cancel it out.<br>

		<p>
			Q1- What is the electric flux through a cube of side 1 cm which encloses an electric dipole ?(Outside Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1,2,3)<br>
			Solution- It is possible to argue that the net flux through the cube is zero since, in accordance with Gauss Law, the net charge enclosed in the surfaces bound by the cube is zero (the dipole is made up of equal and opposite charges).<br><br>

			Q2- How does the electric flux due to a point charge enclosed by a spherical Gaussian surface get affected when its radius is increased ?(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Electric Flux, ϕ=q<sub>enclosed</sub>/ϵ<sub>0</sub><br>Due to the fact that the positive and negative charges in an electric dipole are equally spaced apart. A dipole has zero net charge as a result.Therefore, electric flux is also zero.<br><br>

	    <h3>Topic 14:Energy Stored in a Capacitor</h3>
	    <h3>Topic 15:Van de Graaff Generator</h3>
		<h4>5 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- Draw a labelled diagram of Van de Graaff generator. State its working principle to show how by introducing a small charged sphere into a larger sphere, a large amount of charge can be transferred to the outer sphere. State the use of this machine and also point out its limitations.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)<br>
		Solution- The Van de Graff generator is an electrical apparatus that distributes and gathers electric charge on the exterior using a belt that is driven by a motor. A very high electric potential is produced by this. It is predicated on the idea that like negative charges repel one another and disperse to the sphere's exterior. The diagram below illustrates how the Van de Graff generator is put together.<br>
		<!---yaha diagram aayega-https://www.vedantu.com/question-answer/draw-a-well-labelled-diagram-of-van-de-graff-class-12-physics-cbse-5f9ac27cb6f1596dfcbea789-->
		The Van de Graff is a set of configurations that restricts the direction of charge flow. Furthermore, only charged particles can be accelerated by the Van de Graff. The instrument's limitations are these two things.<br>
                Let's now set the charges on the inner and outer radii to be q and q, respectively.<br>
                Potential on the inner sphere will thus be provided by,<br>
		V(r)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(1)<br>
		Similarly, the potential outer sphere,<br>
		V(R)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(2)<br>
		Now subtracting (2) from (1)<br>V(r)-V(R)=(q/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((1/r)-(1/R))<br>
		The aforementioned demonstrates that the outer sphere's potential will never decrease. Once the two spheres are connected, charge will begin to move between them. More charge will be able to build up on the outer sphere as a result.<br>
                Utilising the Van de Graff, high voltage is produced. It is also employed in scientific experiments as an electrostatic accelerator.<br><br>

			(iii) Why alloys like constantan and manganin are used for making standard resistors ?(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- <br>
			(i) - The average velocity with which the free electron drift under the influence of an electric field is called drift velocity.<br>
			(ii)- <br><img src="ch3top4_q1_5m.jpg"><br>
			A conductor's resistivity is determined by the following variables:<br>
			(1) It is inversely correlated with the number of free electrons in the conductor per unit volume (n).<br>
			(2) It has an inverse relationship with the average relaxation time (τ) of the conductor's free electrons.<br>

			(c) electric current <br>
			(d) electric field.<br>
			Justify your answer.(Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme-2017 Set-1)<br>

			<img src="ch3top4_q2_5m.jpg" alt="Solution"><br>
			(ii) A wire connected across a V-volt battery has a cross-sectional area that increases linearly from one end to the other.  <br>
			Given that the current is independent of the wire's cross-sectional area,  <br>
			The rate of charge flow is known to be I = dq/dt, whereas the drift speed, current density, and electric field are dependent upon the growing cross-section area and are expressed by the following formula:<br>
			Speed of drift = vd = I/Ane<br>
			I/A is the current density.<br>
			Field electric - J/σ<br>

Obtain the expression for (i) the current draw from the cell and (ii) the power consumed in the network.(Delhi Scheme 2017-Set-1)(Delhi Scheme 2017-Set-2)(Delhi Scheme 2017-Set-3)<br>
			<img src="ch3top11_q1_5m.jpg" alt="Solution"><br>
			Solution- (i) The Laws of Kirchhoff: <br>
			First Law: At a junction, the algebraic sum of current is zero, or ∑I 0. This suggests that the total amount of current flowing into and out of a junction is equal. <br>
			Second Law: In a closed loop, the resistance times the corresponding current in each of the emfs is equal to the algebraic sum of the emfs, or ∑E=∑IR.<br><br>
			(ii) From the above figure, we can use the horizontal symmetry to deduce the current<br>
			As both resistance in the circuit, as well as the internal resistance in the circuit, have the same resistance Y<br>
			The resistance of the loop i will be<br>
			(1/R<sub>i</sub>)=(1/r)+(1/2r)<br>
			1/R<sub>i</sub>=3r/2r<sup>2</sup><br>
			R<sub>i</sub>=2r/3<br>
			Because the circuit | and || are same we can say that<br>
			R<sub>||</sub>=2r/3<br>
			Combined resistance will be<br>
			R=R<sub>|</sub>+R<sub>||</sub><br>
			1/R=(1/R<sub>|</sub>)+(1/R<sub>||</sub>)<br>
			1/R=(1/(2r/3))+(1/(2r/3))<br>
			Therefore, R=r/3<br>
			Now this circuit is series with internal resistance 'r'<br>
			
			The current drawn from the cell will be<br>
			I=3E/4r<br>
			And power consumed by the network<br>
			P=I<sup>2</sup>R<br>
			P=(9E<sup>2</sup>/16r<sup>2</sup>)x4r/3<br>

		<h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- Answer the following:<br>
(a) Why are the connections between the resistors in a meter bridge made of thick copper strips?<br>
(b) Why is it generally preferred to obtain the balance point in the middle of the meter bridge wire?<br>
(c) Which material is used for the meter bridge wire and why?(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set 1,3)<br>



			<!--yaha ak image add karna hai-->
		Solution- a) Copper wire has a very low resistivity. Thick wires are used to connect the resistors in order to boost the cross-sectional rate. As a result, wire resistance is very minimal.
<br>b) In order to raise the metre bridge's sensitivity, a balance point is found in the centre of the wire.<br>
			c) Because of its nearly nonexistent temperature coefficient of resistance, which keeps the resistance of the wire constant as the temperature of the wire rises as a result of current flow, Constantan is used for metre bridge wire.
<br> Total resistance is given by, R<sub>tot</sub>=(R<sub>o</sub>/2)+((R<sub>o</sub>/2).R)/(R<sub>0</sub>/2)+R)=R(R<sub>0</sub>+4R)/2(R<sub>0</sub>+2R)<br>

			<img src="ch3top15_q1_5m.jpg" alt="Solution"><br>
			Solution- <br>
			(i)- Principle of potentiometer: The potential difference across any two points of current carrying wire, having uniform cross-sectional area and material, of the potentiometer is directly proportional to the length between the two points.<br>
			(ii)- According to the given question,<br>E=2V,R=15Ω,R<sub>AB</sub>=10Ω<br>Potential difference across thw wire=(2/25)x10=0.8V/m.<br>
			Therefore, potential gradient = 0.8/1=0.8V/m<br>
			Potential difference across AO = (1.5/1.5)x0.3=0.3V<br>
			Therefore, Length,AO=(0.3/0.8)x100=37.5cm which is the required balance length of the wire.<br><br>
