            Solution- The unit of current that determines whether two parallel, uniform, long linear conductors placed one metre apart in free space will attract or repel one another with a force of 2107 N per metre of length is one ampere.</p>

		<p>Q1- To which part of the electromagnetic spectrum does a wave of frequency 5 × 10^19 Hz belong?(Outside Delhi Scheme Set-1, 2014)<br>
		Solution- A wave of frequency 5×1019 Hz lies in the gamma region of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p><br><br>
          
            <h3>Topic 8: Electric Field Lines</h3>
		<h4>1Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Why do the electrostatic field lines not form closed loops?(Outside Delhi Scheme Set-2, 2014)<br>
		        Solution- The positive charge is where the electrostatic field lines begin, and they terminate at the negative charge. The electrostatic field lines do not form closed loops because there is an isolated positive and negative charge present. They can never start and finish at the same location.
</p><br><br>
		        Q2- Why do the electric field lines never cross each other ?(Outside Delhi Scheme 2014 Set-3)<br>
		Solution- Electric lines of force never intersect each other because at the point of intersection, two tangents can be drawn to the two lines of force. This means two direction of electric field at the point of intersection, which is not possible.<br><br>

			Q1- A parallel plate capacitor of capacitance C is charged to a potential V. It is then connected to another uncharged capacitor having the same capacitance. Find out the ratio of the energy stored in the combined system to that stored initially in the single capacitor.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Energy stored in a capacitor<br>=(1/2)QV=(1/2)CV<sup>2</sup><br>(1/2)(q<sup>2</sup>/C)(any one)<br>Capacitance of the (parallel) combination<br>=C+C=2C<br>Here, the total charge, Q, remains the same:<br>Therefore, initial energy= (1/2)(q<sup>2</sup>/C)<br>and final energy=(1/2)(q<sup>2</sup>/2C)<br>Therefore, final energy/initial energy=1/2<br><br>

			Q2- Define capacitor reactance. Write its S.I. units. (Outside Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1)<br>
			Solution- Capacitive reactance is the term used to describe the capacitor's resistance to alternating current. Ohms, or resistance, is the unit of measure for capacitive reactance. XC is the symbol for capacitive reactance. The formula for capacitive reactance is X<sub>C</sub> = (1/2)(ΠfC).<br><br>

	    <h3>Topic 15:Van de Graaff Generator</h3>
		<h4>5 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- Draw a labelled diagram of Van de Graaff generator. State its working principle to show how by introducing a small charged sphere into a larger sphere, a large amount of charge can be transferred to the outer sphere. State the use of this machine and also point out its limitations.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)<br>
		Solution- The Van de Graff generator is an electrical apparatus that distributes and gathers electric charge on the exterior using a belt that is driven by a motor. A very high electric potential is produced by this. It is predicated on the idea that like negative charges repel one another and disperse to the sphere's exterior. The diagram below illustrates how the Van de Graff generator is put together.<br>
		<!---yaha diagram aayega-https://www.vedantu.com/question-answer/draw-a-well-labelled-diagram-of-van-de-graff-class-12-physics-cbse-5f9ac27cb6f1596dfcbea789-->
		The Van de Graff is a set of configurations that restricts the direction of charge flow. Furthermore, only charged particles can be accelerated by the Van de Graff. The instrument's limitations are these two things.<br>
                Let's now set the charges on the inner and outer radii to be q and q, respectively.<br>
                Potential on the inner sphere will thus be provided by,<br>
		V(r)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(1)<br>
		Similarly, the potential outer sphere,<br>
		V(R)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(2)<br>
		Now subtracting (2) from (1)<br>V(r)-V(R)=(q/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((1/r)-(1/R))<br>
		The aforementioned demonstrates that the outer sphere's potential will never decrease. Once the two spheres are connected, charge will begin to move between them. More charge will be able to build up on the outer sphere as a result.<br>
                Utilising the Van de Graff, high voltage is produced. It is also employed in scientific experiments as an electrostatic accelerator.<br><br>

		<h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- Answer the following:<br>
(a) Why are the connections between the resistors in a meter bridge made of thick copper strips?<br>
(b) Why is it generally preferred to obtain the balance point in the middle of the meter bridge wire?<br>
(c) Which material is used for the meter bridge wire and why?(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set 1,3)<br>



			<!--yaha ak image add karna hai-->
		Solution- a) Copper wire has a very low resistivity. Thick wires are used to connect the resistors in order to boost the cross-sectional rate. As a result, wire resistance is very minimal.
<br>b) In order to raise the metre bridge's sensitivity, a balance point is found in the centre of the wire.<br>
			c) Because of its nearly nonexistent temperature coefficient of resistance, which keeps the resistance of the wire constant as the temperature of the wire rises as a result of current flow, Constantan is used for metre bridge wire.
<br> Total resistance is given by, R<sub>tot</sub>=(R<sub>o</sub>/2)+((R<sub>o</sub>/2).R)/(R<sub>0</sub>/2)+R)=R(R<sub>0</sub>+4R)/2(R<sub>0</sub>+2R)<br>
	Total current through the device is given by, I<sub>total</sub> =V/R<sub>total</sub><br>
