			Q1- Does the charge given to a metallic sphere depend on whether it is hollow or solid? Give reason for your answer. (Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- The charge given to a metallic sphere does not depend on whether it is hollow or solid. This is because the charge resides on the surface of the conductor due to electrostatic repulsion, and it distributes itself uniformly over the surface regardless of the internal structure of the sphere.<br><br>

            <h3>Topic 8: Electric Field Lines</h3>
		<h4>1Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Why do the electrostatic field lines not form closed loops?(Outside Delhi Scheme Set-2, 2014)<br>
		        Solution- The positive charge is where the electrostatic field lines begin, and they terminate at the negative charge. The electrostatic field lines do not form closed loops because there is an isolated positive and negative charge present. They can never start and finish at the same location.<br><br>
			
			Q2- Why do the electric field lines never cross each other ?(Outside Delhi Scheme 2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Electric lines of force never intersect each other because at the point of intersection, two tangents can be drawn to the two lines of force. This means two direction of electric field at the point of intersection, which is not possible.<br><br>

			Q3- Draw the pattern of electric field lines, when a point charge – Q is kept near an uncharged conducting plate.(55-1-1 2019)(55-1-2 2019)(55-1-3 2019)<br>

Find (i) the force on the charge at the center of the shell and at the point A, (ii) the electric flux through the shell.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1,2,3)<br>
			Solution- (a)<br>
			<img src="ch1top9_5mq1.jpg"><br>
			(i) When an electric field is present, the conductor's free charge carriers shift the charge distribution and cause it to self-adjust, resulting in a zero net electric field inside the conductor.  <br>
			(ii) By stretching or reorienting the molecules in a dielectric, the external electric field creates a net dipole moment. The induced dipole moment causes the electric field to oppose the external electric field, albeit not completely cancel it out.<br>

			Q1- What is the electric flux through a cube of side 1 cm which encloses an electric dipole ?(Outside Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1,2,3)<br>
			Solution- It is possible to argue that the net flux through the cube is zero since, in accordance with Gauss Law, the net charge enclosed in the surfaces bound by the cube is zero (the dipole is made up of equal and opposite charges).<br><br>

			Q2- How does the electric flux due to a point charge enclosed by a spherical Gaussian surface get affected when its radius is increased ?(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Electric Flux, ϕ=q<sub>enclosed</sub>/ϵ<sub>0</sub><br>Due to the fact that the positive and negative charges in an electric dipole are equally spaced apart. A dipole has zero net charge as a result.Therefore, electric flux is also zero.<br><br>

			Q3- If the net electric flux through a closed surface is zero, then we can infer <br>
			(A) no net charge is enclosed by the surface.<br>
			(B) uniform electric field exists within the surface.<br>
			(C) electric potential varies from point to point inside the surface.<br>
			(D) charge is present inside the surface.                                     (55/1/1 2020)(55/1/2 2020)(55/1/3 2020)<br><br>
			Solution- (A) no net charge is enclosed by the surface.

					Q1- (a) Define electric flux. Is it a scalar or a vector quantity ? A point charge q is at a distance of d/2 directly above the centre of a square of side d, as shown in the figure. Use Gauss’ law to obtain the expression for the electric flux through the square<br>
					<img src="ch1top13_q1_5m.jpg" alt="Solution"><br>
					(b) If the point charge is now moved to a distance ‘d’ from the centre of the square and the side of the square is doubled, explain how the electric flux will be affected.(55-1 2018 Set 1)(55-2 2018 Set 2)(55-3 2018 Set 3)<br>
					Solution- (a)<br>
					<img src="ch1top13_q1_5m_sol.jpg" alt="Solution"><br><br>
					(b)<br>
					Electric flux stays the same if the charge is now moved to a distance of d from the square's centre and the square's side is doubled. This is because electric flux depends only on the amount of charge and not on the square's side OR position of the charge.<br><br>

			Q1- The space between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor is completely filled in two ways. In the first case, it is filled with a slab of dielectric constant K. In the second case, it is filled with two slabs of equal thickness and dielectric constants K1 and K2 respectively as shown in the figure. The capacitance of the capacitor is same in the two cases. Obtain the relationship between K, K1 and K2.(55/1/1 2020)(55/1/2 2020)(55/1/3 2020)<br>
			<img src="ch2top9_q1_2m.jpg"><br><br>
			Solution- The capacitance of the capacitor filled with a dielectric slab (K) is given by:<br>
			C=Kε<sub>0</sub>A/d<br>
			where, A is the area of the plate, K is the dielectric constant, d is the thickness of the plate.<br>
			When the capacitor is filled with two slabs of equal thickness, the capacitance is as follows:<br>
			C=(2ε<sub>0</sub>A/d)((K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>)/(K<sub>1</sub>)+K<sub>2</sub>)<br>
			Area of the plates remain same and thickness of each slab is d/2.<br>
			It is given that the capacitance is equal. So, equate the above two formulas:<br>
			Kε<sub>0</sub>A/d = (2ε<sub>0</sub>A/d)((K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>)/(K<sub>1</sub>)+K<sub>2</sub>)<br>
			K = 2K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>/(K<sub>1</sub>+K<sub>2</sub>)<br><br>

			Solution- Energy stored in a capacitor<br>=(1/2)QV=(1/2)CV<sup>2</sup><br>(1/2)(q<sup>2</sup>/C)(any one)<br>Capacitance of the (parallel) combination<br>=C+C=2C<br>Here, the total charge, Q, remains the same:<br>Therefore, initial energy= (1/2)(q<sup>2</sup>/C)<br>and final energy=(1/2)(q<sup>2</sup>/2C)<br>Therefore, final energy/initial energy=1/2<br><br>

			Q2- Define capacitor reactance. Write its S.I. units. (Outside Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1,2,3)<br>
			Solution- Capacitive reactance is the term used to describe the capacitor's resistance to alternating current. Ohms, or resistance, is the unit of measure for capacitive reactance. XC is the symbol for capacitive reactance. The formula for capacitive reactance is X<sub>C</sub> = (1/2)(ΠfC).<br><br>

	    <h3>Topic 15:Van de Graaff Generator</h3>
		<h4>5 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- Draw a labelled diagram of Van de Graaff generator. State its working principle to show how by introducing a small charged sphere into a larger sphere, a large amount of charge can be transferred to the outer sphere. State the use of this machine and also point out its limitations.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)<br>
		Solution- The Van de Graff generator is an electrical apparatus that distributes and gathers electric charge on the exterior using a belt that is driven by a motor. A very high electric potential is produced by this. It is predicated on the idea that like negative charges repel one another and disperse to the sphere's exterior. The diagram below illustrates how the Van de Graff generator is put together.<br>
		<!---yaha diagram aayega-https://www.vedantu.com/question-answer/draw-a-well-labelled-diagram-of-van-de-graff-class-12-physics-cbse-5f9ac27cb6f1596dfcbea789-->
		The Van de Graff is a set of configurations that restricts the direction of charge flow. Furthermore, only charged particles can be accelerated by the Van de Graff. The instrument's limitations are these two things.<br>
                Let's now set the charges on the inner and outer radii to be q and q, respectively.<br>
                Potential on the inner sphere will thus be provided by,<br>
		V(r)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(1)<br>
		Similarly, the potential outer sphere,<br>
		V(R)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(2)<br>
		Now subtracting (2) from (1)<br>V(r)-V(R)=(q/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((1/r)-(1/R))<br>
		The aforementioned demonstrates that the outer sphere's potential will never decrease. Once the two spheres are connected, charge will begin to move between them. More charge will be able to build up on the outer sphere as a result.<br>
                Utilising the Van de Graff, high voltage is produced. It is also employed in scientific experiments as an electrostatic accelerator.<br><br>

			Solution- (i) The Laws of Kirchhoff: <br>
			First Law: At a junction, the algebraic sum of current is zero, or ∑I 0. This suggests that the total amount of current flowing into and out of a junction is equal. <br>
			Second Law: In a closed loop, the resistance times the corresponding current in each of the emfs is equal to the algebraic sum of the emfs, or ∑E=∑IR.<br><br>
			(ii) From the above figure, we can use the horizontal symmetry to deduce the current<br>

			Solution- Meter bridge or slide wire bridge is the practical form of a wheat-stone bridge, which is used for measuring unknown resistances. Working principle of meter bridge is that the ratio of resistance of the two lengths of the wire across the position of jockey, where galvanometer shows no deflection, is equal to the ratio of known resistance, R and unknown resistance, S.<br>

(b) Why is it generally preferred to obtain the balance point in the middle of the meter bridge wire?<br>
(c) Which material is used for the meter bridge wire and why?(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set 1,3)<br>



			<!--yaha ak image add karna hai-->
		Solution- a) Copper wire has a very low resistivity. Thick wires are used to connect the resistors in order to boost the cross-sectional rate. As a result, wire resistance is very minimal.
<br>b) In order to raise the metre bridge's sensitivity, a balance point is found in the centre of the wire.<br>
			c) Because of its nearly nonexistent temperature coefficient of resistance, which keeps the resistance of the wire constant as the temperature of the wire rises as a result of current flow, Constantan is used for metre bridge wire.
<br> Total resistance is given by, R<sub>tot</sub>=(R<sub>o</sub>/2)+((R<sub>o</sub>/2).R)/(R<sub>0</sub>/2)+R)=R(R<sub>0</sub>+4R)/2(R<sub>0</sub>+2R)<br>

			Q2- What is end error in a metre bridge? How is it overcome? The resistances in the two arms of the metre bridge are R = 5 Ω and S respectively. <br>
			When the resistance S is shunted with an equal resistance, the new balance length found to be 1.5 l1, where l1 is the initial balancing length. Calculate the value of S.(55-1-1 2019)(55-1-2 2019)(55-1-3 2019)<br>
			<img src="ch3top14_q2_3m.jpg" alt="Solution"><br><br>
			Solution- End error: The shifting of zero of the scale at different points as well as the stray resistance due to non-uniformity of metal wire gives rise to end error in meter bridge.<br>
			<br>End error can be removed by repeating the experiment by interchanging unknown and known resistance and finally taking the mean value of resistance obtained in each experiment.<br>
			Given: The resistance in two arms of meter bridge are R = 5 Ω and 5 Ω.<br>
			According to Wheatstone bridge principle, we have the condition at balancing point as<br>
			R/l<sub>1</sub>=S/(100-l<sub>1</sub>)     ......(1)<br>
			After shunting the resistance S by equal resistance, new balance length is 1.5l<sub>1</sub>. Shunting means connecting resistance in parallel. Thus, after shunting the new resistance, we get<br>
			1/S<sup>'</sup>=(1/S)+(1/S) = 2/5 <br>
			Therefore, S<sup>'</sup>=5/2<br>

			(i)- Principle of potentiometer: The potential difference across any two points of current carrying wire, having uniform cross-sectional area and material, of the potentiometer is directly proportional to the length between the two points.<br>
			(ii)- According to the given question,<br>E=2V,R=15Ω,R<sub>AB</sub>=10Ω<br>Potential difference across thw wire=(2/25)x10=0.8V/m.<br>

		   Solution- AC is preferred over DC because of the following reasons:<br>
				<ul>
					
				<li>Loss of power during transmission of current from the power generation plant to the grid is less in AC than in DC.</li>
				<li>AC can be easily transformed to DC with the help of rectifiers whereas in DC it is not possible.</li>
				<li>AC can be easily stepped up or stepped down by transformers whereas in DC it is not possible because transformers work on a changing emf principle.</li>
				<li>Generation of AC is cheaper than DC power.</li>
				<li>Induction motors work on AC power supply only.</li>

		<p>Q3- (i) When AC source is connected to an ideal inductor. Show that the average power supplied by the source over a complete cycle is zero.</br>(ii)A lamp is connected in series with an inductor and an AC source. What happens to the brightness of the lamp when the key is plugged in and an iron rod is inserted inside the inductor? Explain.(55/1/1, 2019)<br>
			<img src="chapter7img.jpg" alt="circuit"><br>
		   Solution- (i) For an ideal inductor phase difference between current and applied voltage = π/2<br>
				 ∴ Power, P = V<sub>rms</sub>I<sub>rms</sub>cos π/2 = 0<br>
				 Thus the power consumed in a pure inductor is zero.<br><br>
			    (ii) The brightness of the lamp will decrease. When the key is plugged in and the iron rod is inserted inside the inductor, it increases the inductance. Hence, the reactance of the inductor <br>
			     	q(X<sub>L</sub>=ωL)increases. So, the impedance of the circuit (Z=R+jωL) increases, which decreases the current in the circuit.<br>

		<p>Q4- a) In a series LCR circuit connected across an ac source of variable frequency, obtain the expression for its impedance and draw a plot showing its variation with frequency of the ac source.<br> 
		       b) What is the phase difference between the voltages across inductor and the capacitor at resonance in the LCR circuit ? <br>
		   Solution- (a) Let us consider, a resistance of resistance R, an inductor of inductance L, and a capacitor of capacitance C be connected in series across an ac source of frequency f.<br>
			     We know that the potential difference across the resistor is given by :-<br>
			     V<sub>R</sub> = IR cos(wt) = V<sub>Rm</sub>cos(wt)<br>
			     V<sub>Rm</sub> = IR<br>
			     Where, V<sub>cm</sub> is the maximum potential across the capacitor <br>
			     V<sub>cm</sub> = IX<sub>c</sub><br>
			     V<sub>Lm</sub> = IX<sub>L</sub><br>
			     <img src="ch7sol5.png" alt="diagram"><br>
				
			     V = V<sub>c</sub> + V<sub>L</sub> + V<sub>R</sub><br>
			     Thus, By adding it, we can obtain the potential difference across the three components.<br>

    			     V<sup>2</sup> = (V<sub>Lm</sub>-V<sub>Cm</sub><sup>2</sup>+V<sup>2</sup><sub>Rm</sub><br>

			     On substituting, <br>

   			     V<sub>Rm</sub>=IR, V<sub>Cm</sub>=IX<sub>c</sub> and V<sub>Lm</sub>=IX<sub>L</sub><br>

			     So, we get<br>

        		     V<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>=I<sup>2</sup>(X<sub>L</sub>-X<sub>C</sub><sup>2</sup>+I<sup>2</sup>V<sup>2</sup><br>

       	                     V<sup>2</sup><sub>m</sub>=I<sup>2</sup> [ (X<sub>L</sub>-X<sub>C</sub>) +R<sup>2</sup> ]<br>

                             V<sub>m</sub>=I<span>&#8730</span>(X<sub>L</sub>-X<sub>C</sub>)^<sup>2</sup>+R^2<br>

        	             V<sub>m</sub>/I=<span>&#8730</span>(X<sub>L</sub>-X<sub>C</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+R<sup>2</sup><br>

			     Impedance is explained as<br>

 			     Z=V<sub>m</sub>/I<br>

			     Hence, <br>

                             Z=<span>&#8730</span>{(X<sub>L</sub>-X<sub>C</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+R<sup>2</sup><br>

(55-1 Outside Delhi Set-1, 2014) (55-2 Outside Delhi Set-2, 2014)<br>
		   Solution- 	Power factor of the circuit is given by:<br>
				cosϕ=R/Z=R√R<sub>2</sub>+(ωL−1/ωC)<sup>2</sup><br><br>

				Current flowing in the circuit is given by:<br>

				<P>=V<sub>rms</sub>I<sub>rms</sub>cos(ϕ)<br>

				(i) No power is dissipated when P = 0<br>

Do you find the algebraic sum of these voltages more than the source voltage ? If yes, how do you resolve the paradox ?(55/1/MT, 2015) (55/2/MT, 2015)<br>
		   Solution-(a) Capacitive resistance<br>
				X<sub>c</sub> = 1/ωC = 1/2πvC = 1/2π x 50 x 100/π x 10<sup>-6</sup> = 100Ω<br>
				Impedance of the circuit , Z = √R<sup>2</sup>+X<sub>c</sub><sup>2</sup> = √100<sup>2</sup> + 100<sup>2</sup> = 100√2<br>
				Current in the circuit I<sub>rms</sub> = E<sub>rms</sub>/Z = 220/100√2 = 1.56A<br><br>
			    (b) Voltage across resistor V<sub>R</sub> = I<sub>rms</sub>R = 1.56x100 = 156V<br>
				Voltage across capacitor, V<sub>C</sub> = I<sub>rms</sub>C = 1.56x100 = 156V<br>
				The algebric sum of voltages across the combination is:<br>
				V<sub>rms</sub> = V<sub>R</sub> + V<sub>C</sub><br> = 156 + 156 = 312V<br>
				While V<sub>rms</sub> of the source is 220V. <br>Yes the voltage across the combination is more than the voltage of the source. The voltage across the resistor and the capacitor are not in phase. This paradox can be resolved as when the current passes through the capacitor , it lead the voltage V , phase π/2. So, voltage of the source can be given as:<br>V<sub>rms</sub> = √V<sub>R</sub><sup>2</sup> + V<sub>C</sub><sup>2</sup> = √(156)<sup>2</sup> + (156)<sup>2</sup> = 156√2 = 220V<br>

				<ul>
					<li>Electrical heaters</li>

		   Solution- Infrared waves are called heat waves because they cause the atoms and molecules of objects to vibrate, which increases the object's internal energy and temperature.<br>
			     Electromagnetic waves transport momentum, which means they carry energy and momentum while propagating through a medium. When an electromagnetic wave travels through space with energy U and speed c, it transports linear momentum p=U/C. If a surface absorbs the waves completely, it delivers momentum to the surface. If the surface reflects the wave, the momentum delivered by both the incident and reflected waves adds on to give 2p momentum.

		   Solution- (i) Huygens' principle states that every point on a wavefront is the source of secondary wavelets that spread out in all directions at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is the envelope of these secondary wavelets.<br>
			        Each point on the primary wave acts as a source of secondary wavelets. The new wavefront at any instant is the envelope of secondary wavelets at that instant.<br>

			    (ii) Given: focal length of concave mirror = -12 cm, magnification = 3<br>
				 Let u be the distance of the object from the mirror.<br>
				 From the mirror formula,<br>
				 1/v-1/u = 1/12<br>

		   Solution-<br> (a) Wavelength λ=589nm=589×10<sup>-9</sup>m<br>

			     	     Speed of light in air, c=3×10<sup>8</sup>m/s<br>

			             Refractive index of water, μ = 1.33<br>

			     	     The frequency of light does not depend on the property of the medium in which it is travelling. Hence, the frequency of the refracted ray in water will be equal to the frequency of the incident or reflected light in air.<br>

			    	     So Refracted frequency, ν=c/λ=5.09×10<sup>14</sup>Hz<br>


			     	     Speed of light in water is related to the refractive index of water as:<br>
			     	     v=c/μ=2.26×10<sup>8</sup> m/s.<br>
			     	     Wavelength of light in water is given by the relationλ1=v/ν=444×10<sup>-9m=444nm<br>

			<img src="chapter9img3.png" alt="ray diagram">
		   Solution- 
			<ol type="i">
				<li> Both the reflection and refraction take place due to the interaction of light with the atoms at the surface of the separation. Light incident on these atoms, force them to vibrate with the frequency of light. But, the light emitted by these charged atoms is equal to their own frequency of oscillation. So, both the reflected and refracted lights have same frequency.</li>
				<li>The energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the wave. It does not depend on the speed of the wave propagation. Hence the energy of the wave remains same and does not decrease.</li>
				<li>The intensity of light is determined by the number of photons incident per unit area around the point at which intensity is to be determined.
