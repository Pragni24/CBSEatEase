            <h3>Topic 1: Basic Properties of Electric Charge</h3>
            <!-- Add content for Subtopic 4 -->
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Does the charge given to a metallic sphere depend on whether it is hollow or solid? Give reason for your answer. (Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-1)(Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme - 2017 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- The charge given to a metallic sphere does not depend on whether it is hollow or solid. This is because the charge resides on the surface of the conductor due to electrostatic repulsion, and it distributes itself uniformly over the surface regardless of the internal structure of the sphere.<br><br>

		<h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- A charge is distributed uniformly over a ring of radius ‘a’. Obtain an expression for the electric intensity E at a point on the axis of the ring. Hence show that for points at large distances from the ring, it behaves like a point charge. (Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- <a href="https://www.toppr.com/ask/question/a-charge-is-distributed-uniformly-over-a-ring-of-radius-a-obtain-an-expression-for/">Click here for detailed solution</a><br><br>

			Q2- (a) Twelve negative charges of same magnitude are equally spaced and fixed on the circumference of a circle of radius R as shown in Fig. (i). Relative to potential being zero at infinity, find the electric potential and electric field at the centre C of the circle.<br>
			(b) If the charges are unequally spaced and fixed on an arc of 120° of radius R as shown in Fig. (ii), find electric potential at the centre C.(55/1/1 2023)(55/1/2 2023)(55/1/3 2023)<br>
			<img src="ch1top7_q2_3m.jpg"><br><br>
			Solution- (a) (1) The electric potential V at C is the algebraic sum of the electric potentials contributed by all the electrons. Because electric potential is a scalar, the orientations of the electrons do not matter. (2) The electric field at C is a vector quantity and thus the orientation of the electrons is important.<br>
			Calculations: Because the electrons all have the same negative charge −e and are all the same distance R from C,<br>
			V = -12(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)(e/R)<br><br>
			(b)Because the distance between C and each electron is unchanged and orientation is irrelevant. The electric field is no longer zero, however, because the arrangement is no longer symmetric. A net field is now directed toward the charge distribution.<br><br>

            <h3>Topic 5: Electric Field Lines</h3>
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- Why do the electrostatic field lines not form closed loops?(Outside Delhi Scheme Set-2, 2014)<br>
		        Solution- The positive charge is where the electrostatic field lines begin, and they terminate at the negative charge. The electrostatic field lines do not form closed loops because there is an isolated positive and negative charge present. They can never start and finish at the same location.<br><br>
			
			Q2- Why do the electric field lines never cross each other ?(Outside Delhi Scheme 2014 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Electric lines of force never intersect each other because at the point of intersection, two tangents can be drawn to the two lines of force. This means two direction of electric field at the point of intersection, which is not possible.<br><br>

			Q3- Draw the pattern of electric field lines, when a point charge – Q is kept near an uncharged conducting plate.(55-1-1 2019)(55-1-2 2019)(55-1-3 2019)<br>

Find (i) the force on the charge at the center of the shell and at the point A, (ii) the electric flux through the shell.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1,2,3)<br>
			Solution- (a)<br>
			<img src="ch1top9_5mq1.jpg"><br>
			(i) When an electric field is present, the conductor's free charge carriers shift the charge distribution and cause it to self-adjust, resulting in a zero net electric field inside the conductor.  <br>
			(ii) By stretching or reorienting the molecules in a dielectric, the external electric field creates a net dipole moment. The induced dipole moment causes the electric field to oppose the external electric field, albeit not completely cancel it out.<br>
			Polarisation: The polarisation is the induced dipole moment per unit volume. P = Xc E holds for linear isotropic dielectrics with susceptibility Xc.<br>

            <h3>Topic 8: Gauss’s Law And Its Applications</h3>
            <!-- Add content for Subtopic 4 -->
		<h4>1 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>
			Q1- What is the electric flux through a cube of side 1 cm which encloses an electric dipole ?(Outside Delhi Scheme-2015 Set-1,2,3)<br>
			Solution- It is possible to argue that the net flux through the cube is zero since, in accordance with Gauss Law, the net charge enclosed in the surfaces bound by the cube is zero (the dipole is made up of equal and opposite charges).<br><br>

			Q2- How does the electric flux due to a point charge enclosed by a spherical Gaussian surface get affected when its radius is increased ?(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-2)(Delhi Scheme-2016 Set-3)<br>
			Solution- Electric Flux, ϕ=q<sub>enclosed</sub>/ϵ<sub>0</sub><br>Due to the fact that the positive and negative charges in an electric dipole are equally spaced apart. A dipole has zero net charge as a result.Therefore, electric flux is also zero.<br><br>

			Q3- If the net electric flux through a closed surface is zero, then we can infer <br>
			(A) no net charge is enclosed by the surface.<br>
			(B) uniform electric field exists within the surface.<br>
			(C) electric potential varies from point to point inside the surface.<br>

					Q1- (a) Define electric flux. Is it a scalar or a vector quantity ? A point charge q is at a distance of d/2 directly above the centre of a square of side d, as shown in the figure. Use Gauss’ law to obtain the expression for the electric flux through the square<br>
					<img src="ch1top13_q1_5m.jpg" alt="Solution"><br>
					(b) If the point charge is now moved to a distance ‘d’ from the centre of the square and the side of the square is doubled, explain how the electric flux will be affected.(55-1 2018 Set 1)(55-2 2018 Set 2)(55-3 2018 Set 3)<br>
					Solution- (a)<br>
					<img src="ch1top13_q1_5m_sol.jpg" alt="Solution"><br><br>
					(b)<br>
					Electric flux stays the same if the charge is now moved to a distance of d from the square's centre and the square's side is doubled. This is because electric flux depends only on the amount of charge and not on the square's side OR position of the charge.<br><br>

			Q1- The space between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor is completely filled in two ways. In the first case, it is filled with a slab of dielectric constant K. In the second case, it is filled with two slabs of equal thickness and dielectric constants K1 and K2 respectively as shown in the figure. The capacitance of the capacitor is same in the two cases. Obtain the relationship between K, K1 and K2.(55/1/1 2020)(55/1/2 2020)(55/1/3 2020)<br>
			<img src="ch2top9_q1_2m.jpg"><br><br>
			Solution- The capacitance of the capacitor filled with a dielectric slab (K) is given by:<br>
			C=Kε<sub>0</sub>A/d<br>
			where, A is the area of the plate, K is the dielectric constant, d is the thickness of the plate.<br>
			When the capacitor is filled with two slabs of equal thickness, the capacitance is as follows:<br>
			C=(2ε<sub>0</sub>A/d)((K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>)/(K<sub>1</sub>)+K<sub>2</sub>)<br>
			Area of the plates remain same and thickness of each slab is d/2.<br>
			It is given that the capacitance is equal. So, equate the above two formulas:<br>
			Kε<sub>0</sub>A/d = (2ε<sub>0</sub>A/d)((K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub>)/(K<sub>1</sub>)+K<sub>2</sub>)<br>

			Charge flows from a parallel-plate capacitor that has been charged by a battery to a potential difference V to an uncharged capacitor with the same capacitance. This process continues until the potentials of the two capacitors are equal. Common potential is the equal potential of the two capacitors. Initially: <br>

	    <h3>Topic 6:Van de Graff Generator</h3>
		<h4>5 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- Draw a labelled diagram of Van de Graaff generator. State its working principle to show how by introducing a small charged sphere into a larger sphere, a large amount of charge can be transferred to the outer sphere. State the use of this machine and also point out its limitations.(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-1)(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set-2)<br>
		Solution- The Van de Graff generator is an electrical apparatus that distributes and gathers electric charge on the exterior using a belt that is driven by a motor. A very high electric potential is produced by this. It is predicated on the idea that like negative charges repel one another and disperse to the sphere's exterior. The diagram below illustrates how the Van de Graff generator is put together.<br>
		<br><img src="ch2_top6_5m_q2.jpg" alt="Solution"><br>
		The Van de Graff is a set of configurations that restricts the direction of charge flow. Furthermore, only charged particles can be accelerated by the Van de Graff. The instrument's limitations are these two things.<br>
                Let's now set the charges on the inner and outer radii to be q and q, respectively.<br>
                Potential on the inner sphere will thus be provided by,<br>
		V(r)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(1)<br>
		Similarly, the potential outer sphere,<br>
		V(R)=(1/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((Q/R)+(q/r))...............(2)<br>
		Now subtracting (2) from (1)<br>V(r)-V(R)=(q/4πε<sub>0</sub>)((1/r)-(1/R))<br>
		The aforementioned demonstrates that the outer sphere's potential will never decrease. Once the two spheres are connected, charge will begin to move between them. More charge will be able to build up on the outer sphere as a result.<br>
                Utilising the Van de Graff, high voltage is produced. It is also employed in scientific experiments as an electrostatic accelerator.<br><br>

			Solution- (i) The Laws of Kirchhoff: <br>
			First Law: At a junction, the algebraic sum of current is zero, or ∑I 0. This suggests that the total amount of current flowing into and out of a junction is equal. <br>
			Second Law: In a closed loop, the resistance times the corresponding current in each of the emfs is equal to the algebraic sum of the emfs, or ∑E=∑IR.<br><br>
			(ii) From the above figure, we can use the horizontal symmetry to deduce the current<br>
			As both resistance in the circuit, as well as the internal resistance in the circuit, have the same resistance Y<br>
			The resistance of the loop i will be<br>
			(1/R<sub>i</sub>)=(1/r)+(1/2r)<br>
			1/R<sub>i</sub>=3r/2r<sup>2</sup><br>
			R<sub>i</sub>=2r/3<br>
			Because the circuit | and || are same we can say that<br>

			Q1- Explain the principle of working of a meter bridge. Draw the circuit diagram for determination of an unknown resistance using it. (55/1/1 2020)(55/1/2 2020)(55/1/3 2020)<br><br>
			Solution- Meter bridge or slide wire bridge is the practical form of a wheat-stone bridge, which is used for measuring unknown resistances.

		<h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- Answer the following:<br>
(a) Why are the connections between the resistors in a meter bridge made of thick copper strips?<br>
(b) Why is it generally preferred to obtain the balance point in the middle of the meter bridge wire?<br>
(c) Which material is used for the meter bridge wire and why?(Outside Delhi Scheme-2014 Set 1,3)<br>
			<img src="top10_ch3_q2_2m.jpg"><br><br>



		Solution- a) Copper wire has a very low resistivity. Thick wires are used to connect the resistors in order to boost the cross-sectional rate. As a result, wire resistance is very minimal.
<br>b) In order to raise the metre bridge's sensitivity, a balance point is found in the centre of the wire.<br>
			c) Because of its nearly nonexistent temperature coefficient of resistance, which keeps the resistance of the wire constant as the temperature of the wire rises as a result of current flow, Constantan is used for metre bridge wire.
<br> Total resistance is given by, R<sub>tot</sub>=(R<sub>o</sub>/2)+((R<sub>o</sub>/2).R)/(R<sub>0</sub>/2)+R)=R(R<sub>0</sub>+4R)/2(R<sub>0</sub>+2R)<br>

			Q2- What is end error in a metre bridge? How is it overcome? The resistances in the two arms of the metre bridge are R = 5 Ω and S respectively. <br>
			When the resistance S is shunted with an equal resistance, the new balance length found to be 1.5 l1, where l1 is the initial balancing length. Calculate the value of S.(55-1-1 2019)(55-1-2 2019)(55-1-3 2019)<br>
			<img src="ch3top14_q2_3m.jpg" alt="Solution"><br><br>
			Solution- End error: The shifting of zero of the scale at different points as well as the stray resistance due to non-uniformity of metal wire gives rise to end error in meter bridge.<br>
			<br>End error can be removed by repeating the experiment by interchanging unknown and known resistance and finally taking the mean value of resistance obtained in each experiment.<br>
			Given: The resistance in two arms of meter bridge are R = 5 Ω and 5 Ω.<br>
			According to Wheatstone bridge principle, we have the condition at balancing point as<br>
			R/l<sub>1</sub>=S/(100-l<sub>1</sub>)     ......(1)<br>
			After shunting the resistance S by equal resistance, new balance length is 1.5l<sub>1</sub>. Shunting means connecting resistance in parallel. Thus, after shunting the new resistance, we get<br>
			1/S<sup>'</sup>=(1/S)+(1/S) = 2/5 <br>
			Therefore, S<sup>'</sup>=5/2<br>
			and l<sub>1</sub>=1.5l<sub>1</sub>.Using Wheatstone bridge principle, we get<br>
			R/l<sub>1</sub>=S<sup>'</sup>/(100-l<sup>'</sup><sub>1</sub>)<br>
			R/1.5l<sub>1</sub>=S/2(100-1.5l<sub>1</sub>)<br>
			R/l<sub>1</sub>=1.5x5/2(100-1.5l<sub>1</sub>)<br>
			Using Eq. (1), we get<br>
			S/(100-l<sub>1</sub>)=1.5x5/2(100-1.5l<sub>1</sub>)<br>
			-> 2(100-1.5l<sub>1</sub>) = 1.5(100-l<sub>1</sub>)<br>
			-> 200-3.0l<sub>1</sub> = 150-1.5l<sub>1</sub>   -> 1.5l<sub>1</sub> = 50<br>
			That is,<br>
			l<sub>1</sub>=50/1.5=100/3<br>
			Substituing the value of l<sub>1</sub> = 100/3 and R= 5 in Eq(1), we get<br>

This law implies that there are no magnetic monopoles (isolated magnetic poles) in nature. Unlike electric charges, which can exist independently, magnetic poles always come in pairs – north and south poles.<br><br>

Q2- Describe the factors affecting the magnitude of the magnetic flux through a closed surface. <br>
Solution- The magnitude of the magnetic flux through a closed surface depends on several factors. Firstly, it depends on the strength of the magnetic field penetrating the surface.

	<h4>2 Mark Questions</h4>
	<p>
		Q1- Explain why a coil with a ferromagnetic core has higher self-inductance compared to the same coil with an air core.<br>

Solution- A coil with a ferromagnetic core has higher self-inductance because the permeability of the ferromagnetic material is much higher than that of air.

	<h3>Topic 4: self inductance of a long solenoid</h3>
	<h4>3 Mark Questions</h4>
	<p>
		Q1-
Explain the concept of self-inductance of a long solenoid. Derive the expression for the self-inductance of a long solenoid and discuss its significance in electrical circuits.

Solution-
Self-inductance is the property of a conductor or a circuit that opposes any change in the current flowing through it by inducing an electromotive force (emf) in itself. When a varying current flows through a long solenoid, it induces a magnetic field within the solenoid, which in turn induces an emf in the solenoid itself, opposing the change in current.

The expression for the self-inductance (L) of a long solenoid with length (l), cross-sectional area (A), and number of turns per unit length (n) is given by:
L=u0.n^2.A.l where u0 is the permeability of free space.

The significance of self-inductance in electrical circuits, particularly in long solenoids, lies in its ability to store energy in the form of a magnetic field. This stored energy can be released back into the circuit when the current changes, providing a temporary source of electrical energy. Self-inductance also affects the behavior of electrical signals in circuits, causing delays in establishing steady currents or voltages when the current changes. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in the design and operation of various electrical devices such as transformers, electromagnets, and inductors, where controlling or manipulating currents is necessary for various functions.

	<h4>5 Mark Question</h4>
	<p>
		Q1-

Explain the concept of self-inductance in a long solenoid. Derive the expression for the self-inductance of a long solenoid and discuss its significance in electromagnetic phenomena. Provide relevant equations,  and practical applications to illustrate your answer.<br>

Solution-

Concept of Self-Inductance in a Long Solenoid:

Self-inductance is a property of a circuit or a conductor that opposes any change in the current flowing through it by inducing an electromotive force (emf) in itself. In a long solenoid, which consists of many closely spaced turns of wire wound in a helical shape, self-inductance arises due to the magnetic field produced by the current flowing through the solenoid.

Expression for Self-Inductance of a Long Solenoid:

The self-inductance (L) of a long solenoid with length (l), cross-sectional area (A), and number of turns per unit length (n) is given by the formula:
L=u0.n^2.A.l where 
 -u0 is the permeability of free space (
 -n is the number of turns per unit length.
 -A is the cross-sectional area of the solenoid.
 -l is the length of the solenoid.
Significance of Self-Inductance in Electromagnetic Phenomena:

Opposition to Change in Current: Self-inductance opposes any change in the current flowing through the solenoid. When the current in the solenoid changes, it induces an emf in the solenoid, creating a back electromotive force that counteracts the change in current.

Energy Storage: Self-inductance allows energy to be stored in the magnetic field of the solenoid. When the current through the solenoid increases, energy is stored in the magnetic field, which can be released when the current decreases.

Inductive Reactance: In AC circuits, self-inductance causes inductive reactance, which is the opposition to the change in current flow due to the changing magnetic field. This property influences the behavior of AC circuits, affecting their impedance and phase relationships.

Applications: Self-inductance in long solenoids is utilized in various applications such as inductors for filtering signals in electronic circuits, transformers for voltage regulation, electromagnets for lifting heavy objects, and solenoid valves for controlling fluid flow in pneumatic and hydraulic systems.

Conclusion:

Self-inductance in a long solenoid is a fundamental concept in electromagnetism, influencing the behavior of circuits and magnetic devices. Its understanding is crucial in designing and analyzing electromagnetic systems and devices, making it a cornerstone of modern electrical engineering.<br><br>

	<h4>1 Mark Questions</h4>
	<p>
		Q1-State the factor that determines the magnitude of induced electromotive force (emf) in a coil when changing the area enclosed by the coil.
		Solution-The rate of change of the magnetic flux through the coil determines the magnitude of induced electromotive force (emf) when changing the area enclosed by the coil.
	</p>

	<h4>3 Mark Questions</h4>
	<p>
		Q1- Describe the phenomenon of induced electromotive force (emf) by changing the area of a coil. Explain how the induced emf is related to the rate of change of area and the magnetic flux through the coil.<br>

Solution-When the area of a coil changes, the magnetic flux through the coil also changes according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This change in magnetic flux induces an emf in the coil, which opposes the change causing it. The induced emf (
E) is directly proportional to the rate of change of area (dA/dt) according to the equation E=−dΦ/dt =−d(BA)/dt, where B is the magnetic field strength. Therefore, a faster change in area results in a greater induced emf.<br><br>

			<img src="chapter7img.jpg" alt="circuit"><br>
		   Solution- (i) For an ideal inductor phase difference between current and applied voltage = π/2<br>

				 Thus the power consumed in a pure inductor is zero.<br><br>
			    (ii) The brightness of the lamp will decrease. When the key is plugged in and the iron rod is inserted inside the inductor, it increases the inductance. Hence, the reactance of the inductor <br>

			     <img src="ch7sol5.png" alt="diagram"><br>

		<p>Q3-  (i) Draw the diagram of a device which is used to decrease high ac voltage into a low ac voltage and state its working principle. Write four sources of energy loss in this device. <br>
			(ii) A small town with a demand of 1200 kW of electric power at 220 V is situated 20 km away from an electric plant generating power at 440 V. The resistance of the two wire line carrying power is 0.5  per km. The town gets the power from the line through a 4000-220 V step-down transformer at a sub-station in the town. Estimate the line power loss in the form of heat.(55/1/1, 2019)(55/1/2, 2019)(55/1/3, 2019)<br>
		   Solution-<br>
			(i)	The device used to decrease high ac voltage into a low ac voltage is called transformer (step-down transformer).<br>
				Working principle: Transformer works on the principle of Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction. The law of electromagnetic induction states that when magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an emf is induced in the coil.<br>
				<p>Transformer consists of two coils called primary coil and secondary coil. The ac current in primary coil changes magnetic flux linked with the secondary coil and thus an emf is induced in the secondary coil.</p>
				Sources of energy loss in transformer:<br>
				<ol  type='a'>
					<li>Copper loss: The coils of transformer (made of copper) have a finite resistance due to which some energy in lost as heat.  </li>
					<li>Iron loss: Due to induced eddy currents in the iron core, some energy is lost in the bulk.</li>
					<li>Magnetic loss: Since all magnetic flux in primary coil does not pass through the secondary coil, there is some loss of energy due to leakage of flux. </li>
					<li>Hysteresis loss: alternating magnetization and demagnetization of the iron core cause some loss of energy in form of heat.</li>
				</ol><br>
			(ii) Given:<br> • Electric power required by small town: P = 1200 kW = 1200 x 103 W. <br>
					• Supply voltage: 220 V.  • Electric power generated at electric plant is 440 V.<br>
					• Resistance of wire carrying power = 0.5 Ω per km <br>
					• Distance between town and electric power generator is 20 km.<br>
					Total resistance of the wire is R = 0.5(20 + 20) = 20 Ω. <br>
					Town gets power from a step-down transformer of rating 4000–220 V.  <br>
					Thus, the input voltage is 4000 V = Vin. Output voltage is 220 V = Vout. <br>
					Therefore, the rms current in the wire is<br>
					I<sub>rms</sub> = P/V<sub>in</sub> = 1200 x 10<sup>3</sup>/4000 = 300<br>
					Power loss in the form of heat is<br>
					I<sup>2</sup><sub>rms</sub>R = (300)<sup>2</sup> x 20 
					9 x 10<sup>4</sup>x20= 1800 x 10<sup>3</sup>W<br>
					Therefore, the power loss in form of heat is 1800 kW.<br>

Resistance is caused by electrons in a conductor colliding with the ionic lattice of the conductor. This results in the conversion of electrical energy into heat. Impedance is the measure of the nature of opposition of the AC electricity. This opposition varies with the frequency.<br>

		</p>
		<p>Q3- In which directions do the electric and magnetic field vectors oscillate in an electromagnetic wave propagating along the x-axis? (55-3 All India Set-3, 2017)<br>
		   Solution- The cross product of electric and magnetic field vectors i.e. E → × B → gives the direction in which the wave travels. It is given that wave is propagating along the x-axis. This means that electric field vector is oscillating in positive y-​direction and magnetic field vector in positive z-direction.<br>

		   Solution- Microwaves:<br>
		             Microwaves are produced by vacuum tube devices that use magnetic or electric fields to control the movement of electrons. Microwaves are used for:
				<ul>
					<li>Cooking food</li>

		  	     Infrared waves:<bR>
			     Infrared waves are produced by hot bodies and molecules. They are also known as heat waves. Infrared waves are used for:
				<ul>
					<li>Electrical heaters</li>
					<li>Infrared cameras</li>
				</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Q2- Why are infra-red waves often called heat waves ? Explain. What do you understand by the statement, ‘‘Electromagnetic waves transport momentum’’ ?(55/1, 2018) (55/2, 2018) (55/3, 2018)<br>
		   Solution- Infrared waves are called heat waves because they cause the atoms and molecules of objects to vibrate, which increases the object's internal energy and temperature.<br>
			     Electromagnetic waves transport momentum, which means they carry energy and momentum while propagating through a medium. When an electromagnetic wave travels through space with energy U and speed c, it transports linear momentum p=U/C. If a surface absorbs the waves completely, it delivers momentum to the surface. If the surface reflects the wave, the momentum delivered by both the incident and reflected waves adds on to give 2p momentum.

		   Solution- (i) Huygens' principle states that every point on a wavefront is the source of secondary wavelets that spread out in all directions at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wavefront is the envelope of these secondary wavelets.<br>
			        Each point on the primary wave acts as a source of secondary wavelets. The new wavefront at any instant is the envelope of secondary wavelets at that instant.<br>

				t=AP′sin r/ν+AK(sin i/c−sin r/ν)<br>
				The incident rays will fall at the same time at corresponding points of the refracted wavefront if it is independent of AK<br>

			    (ii) Given: focal length of concave mirror = -12 cm, magnification = 3<br>
				 Let u be the distance of the object from the mirror.<br>
				 From the mirror formula,<br>
				 1/v-1/u = 1/12<br>

			             Refractive index of water, μ = 1.33<br>

			     	     The frequency of light does not depend on the property of the medium in which it is travelling. Hence, the frequency of the refracted ray in water will be equal to the frequency of the incident or reflected light in air.<br>

			    	     So Refracted frequency, ν=c/λ=5.09×10<sup>14</sup>Hz<br>

			      For △NOC, i is the exterior angle.<br>
			      Assuming the incident ray is very close to the principal axis, all the angles are very small. Hence, for very small angles,<br>

		   Solution- In this case the biconvex lens will behave as a <b>diverging lens</b> because the refractive index of water (1.33) is more than that of the material (1.25) of the lens.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Q2- A biconcave lens made of a transparent material of refractive index 1.25 is immersed in water of refractive index 1.33. Will the lens behave as a converging or a diverging lens ? Give reason. (55-3 Outside Delhi Set-3, 2014)<br>
		   Solution- Since refractive index of lens w.r.t. water is 1.25/1.37 which is less than one, hence biconcave lens will behave like <b>converging lens</b>.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Q3- The line AB in the ray diagram represents a lens. State whether the lens is convex or concave.(55/1/MT, 2015) (55/2/MT, 2015) (55/3/MT, 2015)<br>

		<p>Q1- A convex lens of focal length 20 cm is placed coaxially with a convex mirror of radius of curvature 20 cm. The two are kept at 15 cm from each other. A point object lies 60 cm in front of the√2 convex lens. Draw a ray diagram to show the formation of the image by the combination. Determine the nature and position of the image formed. (55-1 Outside Delhi Set-1, 2014)<br>
		   Solution- 	Lens formula for convex lens,<br>

				1/v−1/u=1/f<br>

				1/v−1/−60=1/20<br>

				v=30 cm<br>

				Image (I1) formed by the convex lens acts as an object for the convex mirror.<br>

				Since the mirror and lens are separated by 15 cm, distance between I<sub>1</sub> and mirror is 15 cm.<br>

				i.e. u=15<br>

				For convex mirror,<br>

				f=R/2=10 cm<br>

				From mirror equation,<br>

				1/v<sub>2</sub>+1/u<sub>2</sub>=1/f<sub>2</sub><br>

				1/v<sub>2</sub>+1/15=1/10<br>

				v<sub>2</sub>=30 cm

				Hence, image is formed 30 cm right of the convex mirror.<br>

				From the ray diagram, it can be observed that the image is virtual.<br>

		<p>Q2- A convex lens of focal length 20 cm is placed coaxially with a concave mirror of focal length 10 cm at a distance of 50 cm apart from each other. A beam of light coming parallel to the principal axis is incident on the convex lens. Find the position of the final image formed by this combination. Draw the ray diagram showing the formation of the image. (55-2 Outside Delhi Set-2, 2014)<br>
		   Solution- 	Let us first locate the image of the point object S formed by the convex lens.<br>
				Here u=−∞cm and f=20cm<br>
				From the lens formula, we have<br>
				1/v−1/u=1/f<br>
				⇒1/v=1/f+1/u<br>
				⇒1/v=1/20+1/−∞<br>
				⇒1/v=1/20<br>
				⇒v=20cm<br>
				The positive sign shows that the image is formed to the right of the lens,as shown in the figure.<br>
				The image I<sub>1</sub> is formed in front of the mirror and hence, acts as a real source for the mirror.The concave mirror forms the image I<sub>2</sub>, whose distance from the mirror can be calculated as:<br>
				1/v=1/f+1/u<br>
				Here,u=−30cm and f=−10cm<br>
				⇒1/v=−1/10+1/30<br>
				⇒1/v=(1−3)/30=−2/30<br>
				⇒v=−15cm<br>
				Hence, the final image is formed at a distance of 15cm from the concave mirror, as shown in the following figure.<br>

				Consider a light ray parallel to the principal axis striking the mirror at M. C is the centre of curvature of the mirror. So, CMwill be normal to the mirror at the point of incidence M.<br>
				Let θ be the angle of incidence and MD be the perpendicular from M on the principal axis. Then<br>
				∠MCP = θ and ∠MFP = 2θ<br>
				Now, tanθ = MD/CD and tan2θ = MD/FD  ...(i)<br>
				For paraxial rays, θ is small, so<br>
				tanθ ≈ θ and tan2θ ≈ 2θ <br>
				∴MD/FD = 2MD/CD OR FD = CD/2 ...(ii)<br>
				For small θ, point D is very close to point P. Therefore, FD=f and CD=R.<br>

			<img src="chapter9img3.png" alt="ray diagram"><br>
		   Solution- 
			<ol type="i">
				<li> Both the reflection and refraction take place due to the interaction of light with the atoms at the surface of the separation. Light incident on these atoms, force them to vibrate with the frequency of light. But, the light emitted by these charged atoms is equal to their own frequency of oscillation. So, both the reflected and refracted lights have same frequency.</li>
				<li>The energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the wave. It does not depend on the speed of the wave propagation. Hence the energy of the wave remains same and does not decrease.</li>
				<li>The intensity of light is determined by the number of photons incident per unit area around the point at which intensity is to be determined.

		<h4>5 Marks Questions</h4>
		<p>Q1- (a) Define a wavefront. Using Huygens’ principle, verify the laws of reflection at a plane surface.<br> 
		(b) In a single slit diffraction experiment, the width of the slit is made double the original width. How does this affect the size and intensity of the central diffraction band ? Explain.<br> 
		(c) When a tiny circular obstacle is placed in the path of light from a distant source, a bright spot is seen at the centre of the obstacle. Explain why. (55/1 2018) (55/3 2018)<br>         
		Solution:<br>(a) (i) A wavefront is defined as the continuous locus of all the particles which are vibrating in the same phase.
		The perpendicular line drawn at any point on the wavefront represents the direction of propagation of the wave at that point.<br>
		(ii) Verification of Laws of Reflection using Huygen's Principle<br>
		In the given figure, AB is the wavefront incident on a reflecting surface XY with an angle of incidence i as shown in figure. According to Huygen’s principle, every point on AB acts as a source of secondary wavelets. At first, wave incidents at point A and then to points C, D and E. They form a sphere of radii AA1, CC1 and DD1 as shown in figure.
		A1E represents the tangential envelope of the secondary wavelet in forward direction.<br>
		In ΔABE and ΔAA1E,<br>
		∠ABE = ∠AA1E = 90°<br>
		Side AE = Side AE<br>
		AA1 = BE = distance travelled by wave in same time<br>
		So, these triangles are congruent.<br>
		So, ∠BAE = i and ∠BEA =r<br>
		Thus, i = r<br>
		Hence, angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This is the first law of reflection.<br>
		Since, the incident wavefront AB, normal and reflected wavefront A1E lies in same plane, it verifies the second law of reflection.<br>
		In this way, laws of reflection is verified by Huygens’s principle.<br>

		(b) The width of the central maximum is given by<br>
		<sup>2Dλ</sup>&frasl;<sub>d</sub> where d is the slit width.<br>
		On doubling the width of the slit, the size of diffraction band reduces to half value.<br>
		When the width of central maxima is reduced to half, area of central diffraction band will become one fourth. And hence the intensity will become four times.<br><br>
		(c) It is so because wave diffracted from the edge of the circular obstacle interfere to form constructive interference at the centre of the obstacle.<br>

			 Q1:Explain the role of a transmitter in a communication system. How does it convert the message into a suitable form for transmission?(2016)<br>
			 Solution:Role of a Transmitter in a Communication System 

The transmitter is a critical component of a communication system as it is responsible for converting the message into a suitable form for transmission. Here is a detailed explanation of its role:

1. Message Encoding: The transmitter begins by encoding the message into a format that can be transmitted effectively. This process involves converting the message, which could be in the form of text, voice, data, or any other information, into a signal that can be carried by the communication channel. For instance, in digital communication systems, the message is typically converted into binary digits (0s and 1s) using encoding techniques such as modulation.

2. Signal Processing: After encoding the message, the transmitter processes the signal to prepare it for transmission. This step may include amplifying the signal to ensure it has sufficient strength to travel through the communication channel without significant loss of quality. Additionally, the transmitter may perform filtering and shaping operations to meet the requirements of the communication channel and minimize interference from noise.

3. Modulation : In many communication systems, the transmitter modulates the encoded signal onto a carrier wave. Modulation involves varying some characteristic of the carrier wave, such as its amplitude, frequency, or phase, in accordance with the encoded signal. This process allows the signal to be transmitted efficiently over the communication channel and enables multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously without interfering with each other.

4. Transmission : Finally, the transmitter transmits the modulated signal over the communication channel, which could be a wired or wireless medium like a cable, fiber-optic link, or radio wave. The transmitted signal carries the encoded message and is received by the receiver at the other end of the communication system.

In conclusion, the transmitter plays a crucial role in a communication system by converting the message into a suitable form for transmission. It achieves this through message encoding, signal processing, modulation, and transmission, ensuring that the message can be effectively communicated to the receiver.

		 <h3>Topic 3:Modulation and its Necessity</h3>
		 <h4>5 Marks Questions</h4>
		 <p>
                         Q1:What is Modulation And Its Types?(2015)<br>
			 Solution:Modulation is one of the crucial branches of electronics science that is widely used in communication systems. It includes the different fundamental properties of the signal to transpose it from one location to another. 

Types of Signals used in the Modulation

Modulating Signal: This is the signal that contains the message to be transmitted from the sender to the receiver and is called a message signal. Generally, the message signals are the band of low or high frequencies and are often called baseband signals. The message signals are the signals to be transmitted from the sender to the receiver. The frequency of the message signals to be sent is generally low. Thus, these signals undergo modulation to get correctly transmitted from one location to another.

Carrier Signal: The other signal used in the process of modulation is the carrier signal that has high-frequency sinusoidal waves. The high-frequency carrier wave can travel much quicker as compared to the baseband signal. These signals have a specific frequency, amplitude, and phase, but no information. After modulation, carrier signals are used to transmit the signal to the receiver. 

Modulated Signal: After the modulation is done, the resultant signal refers to the modulated signal. This signal is the mixture of the carrier signal and message signal. <br><br>

                         Q2:Describe the process of modulation and demodulation in communication systems.Explain how modulation enables the transmission of information over long distances. (2012)<br>
			 Solution: Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a high-frequency carrier signal according to the characteristics of a lower-frequency message signal, which typically contains the information to be transmitted. Demodulation is the reverse process, where the original message signal is recovered from the modulated carrier signal at the receiver.

1. **Modulation Process**:
   - **Message Signal**: The message signal is the original signal containing the information to be transmitted. This signal is typically a low-frequency signal.
   - **Carrier Signal**: The carrier signal is a high-frequency signal that is modulated to carry the information from the message signal. The carrier signal provides the means for the message signal to propagate over long distances.
   - **Modulator**: The modulator is a device that combines the message signal with the carrier signal to produce the modulated signal. The modulator varies the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the carrier signal according to the message signal.
   - **Modulated Signal**: The modulated signal is the result of combining the message signal with the carrier signal. It carries the information from the message signal in a form suitable for transmission over the communication channel.

2. **Demodulation Process**:
   - **Received Signal**: The received signal is the modulated signal that has traveled through the communication channel and reached the receiver.
   - **Demodulator**: The demodulator is a device that extracts the original message signal from the modulated carrier signal. The demodulator reverses the modulation process to recover the original message signal.
   - **Recovered Signal**: The recovered signal is the original message signal that has been extracted by the demodulator. It is a faithful reproduction of the message signal transmitted by the sender.

3. **Transmission over Long Distances**:
   - Modulation enables the transmission of information over long distances by using high-frequency carrier signals. High-frequency signals can propagate further than low-frequency signals without significant attenuation or distortion.
   - Modulation also allows for the efficient use of the available frequency spectrum. By modulating the carrier signal, multiple signals can be transmitted simultaneously over different frequency bands without interference.

In summary, modulation enables the transmission of information over long distances by modulating a high-frequency carrier signal with a lower-frequency message signal. Demodulation at the receiver extracts the original message signal from the modulated carrier signal, allowing for the recovery of the transmitted information.<br><br>

		  <h3>Topic 4:Amplitude Modulation</h3>
		 <h4>3 Marks Questions</h4>
		 <p>
                       Q1:Explain the process of Amplitude Modulation (AM) in detail, including the role of the carrier signal and modulating signal.(2011)<br>
		Solution:Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a modulation technique used in communication systems to encode information onto a carrier wave. In AM, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal. The modulating signal contains the information to be transmitted, such as audio signals in broadcasting. The carrier signal is a high-frequency sinusoidal wave that is modulated by the modulating signal. The modulated signal consists of the sum and difference frequencies of the carrier and modulating signals.	 
                  <br> <br>

			Q2:Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Amplitude Modulation (AM).(2012)<br>
		Solution:Advantages of AM include simplicity of implementation, compatibility with existing radio receivers, and efficiency in power usage. Disadvantages include susceptibility to noise and interference, lower bandwidth efficiency compared to other modulation techniques like Frequency Modulation (FM), and the need for larger antennas for long-distance communication.     
                      <br> <br>

			Q3:Describe the process of demodulation in AM. How is the original modulating signal recovered at the receiver?(20123<br>
		Solution:Demodulation in AM involves extracting the original modulating signal from the modulated carrier wave. This is typically done using a diode detector or envelope detector circuit. The demodulator rectifies the modulated signal to recover the envelope of the carrier wave, which contains the original modulating signal. Low-pass filtering is then used to remove the high-frequency carrier wave, leaving the original modulating signal.

		  <h4>5 Marks Questions</h4>

			 Q1:Explain the concept of sidebands in AM. How are sidebands generated in the modulation process?(2018)<br>
			 Solution:Sidebands in Amplitude Modulation (AM) refer to the spectral components that are created when a carrier signal is modulated by a modulating signal. These sidebands contain the information from the modulating signal and are located at frequencies above and below the carrier frequency.

The generation of sidebands in the modulation process can be understood by considering the mathematical representation of an AM signal. The modulated signal can be expressed as:

\[ s(t) = A_c \cdot [1 + m \cdot m_s(t)] \cdot \cos(2 \pi f_c t) \]

Where:
- \( s(t) \) is the modulated signal.
- \( A_c \) is the amplitude of the carrier signal.
- \( m \) is the modulation index.
- \( m_s(t) \) is the modulating signal.
- \( f_c \) is the frequency of the carrier signal.
- \( t \) is the time.

In this equation, the term \( [1 + m \cdot m_s(t)] \) represents the varying amplitude of the carrier signal due to modulation. When expanded, this term produces a carrier signal and two sidebands:

1. **Upper Sideband (USB)**: The upper sideband is located at a frequency equal to the sum of the carrier frequency and the modulating frequency (\( f_c + f_m \)), where \( f_m \) is the frequency of the modulating signal. It contains the same information as the modulating signal but shifted to a higher frequency.

2. **Lower Sideband (LSB)**: The lower sideband is located at a frequency equal to the difference between the carrier frequency and the modulating frequency (\( f_c - f_m \)). It also contains the information from the modulating signal but shifted to a lower frequency.

Thus, when a carrier signal is modulated by a modulating signal in an AM system, sidebands are generated on either side of the carrier frequency, containing the information from the modulating signal. These sidebands are essential for transmitting the modulating signal and are crucial in the demodulation process to recover the original signal at the receiver.
